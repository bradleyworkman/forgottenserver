      his morning, a failure of our forum database caused a downtime of our website. Also the login for the game servers was affected for awhile. Everything is back to normal now. We sincerely regret the inconvenience.
      <br>
      <br>
      Today we also have some really good news for you. We have fixed a bug that affected very old characters. Finally, they can run now at the same speed like all other characters of the same level. So do not wonder if some old sorcerer throws away his crutches today and challenges you to a race.
      <br>
      <br>
      Kind regards,
      <br>
      Your CipSoft Team
