      ancy a new set of clothes for your battle-hardened hero? Then this is the update teaser for you! Today you will learn all you need to know about the cool new outfits that will be available with the update.
      <br>
      <br>
      All of the 4 basic outfits have been revamped - just take a look at the gallant new knight and the nimble hunter! What's more, 11 Premium outfits will be available, 8 of them are completely new, so Premium players will now be able to choose from a total of 15 unique outfits! However, not all of these new outfits will be available immediately. While you can choose to look like a ... barbarian, a ... wizard or a ... druid right away, you will have to solve challenging quests before you will be allowed to dress up like a grim assassin or a fierce pirate. Further outfits are hidden somewhere, so make sure to ask any people you meet about their outfit!

      But there is more!
      Premium
      players will be able to find additional accessories for their outfits. Now, each outfit can be upgraded further by activating so-called addons. All over Tibia you may now come across NPCs wearing these special accessories. Ask them about their addon to learn how you can gain these addons for yourself. But be warned, the missions they will send you on may be tough! Your journey will be long and tiring, dreadful monsters must be overcome, and treasures hidden in dark and secret places must be unearthed. However, the daring heroes who brave the many challenges will be able to impress other adventurers with their snazzy outfit addons. Take on the challenge and win an addon for your favourite outfit as a token of your bravery!
