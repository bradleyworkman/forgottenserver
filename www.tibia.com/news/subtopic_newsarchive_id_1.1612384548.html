      fter the introduction of the newbie isle and numerous changes in the
game rules during the last months, we are proud to present the next great
update. This time, we did not only improve the game itself, but also moved
our server to a new place and created a new look for our website (as you
can see :-).
      <br>
      <br>
      As our studies and with that our performance at the University of
Passau is coming to an end, we had to look for a new home for our server. In
Gamez.de we have found a strong partner who provides us with a powerful
computer with fast access to the internet. In return we will put banner
adverts on our website. This allows us to keep the game free of charge and
adverts.
      <br>
      <br>
      The new Tibia website has more content and a better structure. Here you
will find the latest information about the game and the official forum of the
Tibian community. Everyone who has a character in Tibia can post in our forum.
Simply use your name and password from Tibia. In order to further improve the website, we want to ask everyone to submit tutorials, stories, hints, and pictures. We are looking forward to all contributions.
      <br>
      <br>
      Although there are only a few technical innovations in the game, the update
will drastically change the appearance of Tibia. Due to huge efforts and
great support by many artists, we could finally replace many old graphics that are giving Tibia another piece of individuality. We hope that you will quickly grow fond of the new style.
      <br>
      <br>
      At this point, we want to express our thanks to the artists that made this
step possible. To Mantus for the many beautiful weapons and items of
daily use as well as numerous spectacular monsters. To King Crimson for the
realistic trees, bushes and stones. To Elleshar and Ralgar, who have
untiringly worked out the list of missing objects. To Aureus for all objects
of his upcoming area. Also to Knightmare, Conaria, Wastl, Lomaxx, Apoc, and
many more. Thanks to all of you!
      <br>

      Besides that, there are some small changes with the client program: Another
mechanism shall prevent multiple clients at one host. The names of ignored
users may now also include the wildcards '*' (stands for arbitrarily many
characters) and '?' (stands for exactly one character). For security reasons,
the password will no longer be saved in the preferences; it will be
displayed for the last time when you start the new client. The last
improvement concerns the communication with the server: A new technique
shall reduce the so called screen-bugs.
      <br>
      <br>
      Have a lot of fun in Tibia!
      <br>
