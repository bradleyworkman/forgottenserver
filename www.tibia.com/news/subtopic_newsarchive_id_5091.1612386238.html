        I reached Kilmaresh about a week ago and have been travelling through this wondrous vast land since then. Astonishment and wonder have been my constant companions for this place is truly something else.

        Yet, I do sense it as well. Evil is slowly eating its way into the life and soul of Kilmaresh. So my time is short for my help is needed direly here. At this very moment, I'm trying to gather evidence to unmask a traitor who's consorting with the forbidden cult of Fafnar. Those cultists have turned into a real threat. They are corrupting the hearts of more and more living creatures here.
        <br>
        The times we live in, Jack, they are turbulent and chaotic. When delightful ballads during a theatre performance not only sent the audience into rapture but also powerful demons into this realm, you know that someone is weaving a web of deceit to prey on unsuspecting victims.

       a thousand years ago, Kilmaresh formed a contiguous land mass with Krailos and Oramond. It was inhabited by a human civilization that had established a thriving empire. They had built large cities, engaged in advanced seafaring and stood at a high scientific, arcane and cultural level.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people of this old empire worshipped the two sun gods, Suon and Fafnar. They attached great importance to the fact that the worship of both deities was always in balance. Alas, there came a time when a group of Fafnar's adherers became more and more influential and aggressive until they postulated the sole worship of Fafnar. This resulted in a civil war between the Fafnar followers and those who fought for the duality of the two sun gods. Ultimately, the war was ended by Suon himself. He split off the eastern peninsula from the western part of the landmass by a strait, destroying the former capital Nuur. This event has been known as
       <em>
        Suon's Wrath
       </em>
       ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <strong>
        Anuma
       </strong>
       <img align="right" height="305" hspace="10" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/manticore.jpg', 'summer', 'width=586, height=692')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/manticore_small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer;" width="250">
       then took control of Kilmaresh to prevent humans from foolishly causing a disaster again and thus, a new empire arose. The Anuma are magical beings that, according to legend, were once created by the sun gods: sphinxes, lamassu, gryphons and manticores. Before Suon's Wrath, they had barely maintained contact with the ancient empire. The Anuma established several laws for the new empire that all humans had to comply with. A wise sphinx, lamassu or gryphon has been taking on the role of empress or emperor ever since. These days, a sphinx empress rules over Kilmaresh wisely and benevolently.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Sphinxes
       </strong>
       have a leonine body, big feathered wings and human heads with their faces being a mix of humanoid and feline. They are highly intelligent and allegedly immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manticores
       </strong>
       are ferocious creatures, with the body of a lion, a human face, leathery wings and a huge scorpion tail. They are lethal predators which have a preference for human flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Lamassu
       </strong>
       <img align="left" height="305" hspace="10" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/gryphon.jpg', 'summer', 'width=586, height=692')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/gryphon_small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer;" width="250">
       have the body of a bull, feathered wings and a human head. They are benevolent towards humans - unless you disturb the peace of holy sites or graveyards. In this case they can be very unforgiving.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Gryphons
       </strong>
       have the body, tail and back legs of a lion but the forelegs, head and wings of an eagle or hawk. It is said that out of all Anuma, the sun god Suon loved the gryphons most whereas his wild sister Fafnar favoured the manticores. In very rare cases, a gryphon will forge a bond with a human it regards worthy. If this happens, the gryphon will agree to carry the mortal on its back.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Suon's Wrath,
       <img align="right" height="176" hspace="10" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/kil_3.png', 'summer', 'width=480, height=352')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/kil_3.png" style="cursor: pointer;" width="240">
       Fafnar's worship was banned and prohibited. However, there was still no unity among the humans of Kilmaresh. Some now demanded the sole worship of Suon, while others insisted that there must always be a divine duality. They regarded the sea goddess Bastesh as Suon's true new sister. The Anuma intervened to prevent further religious fights. They decreed that both - the sole worship of Suon or Bastesh as well as the worship of both gods together - should be allowed. Only the worship of Fafnar remained prohibited. Nonetheless, a Fafnar cult outlasted in the hiding and is hoping for the return of the Wild Sun for centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past, numerous enslaved ogres lived on Kilmaresh, but the Anuma freed them after Suon's Wrath and took most of them to Krailos. A single tribe still lives north of the ruined city Nuur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Krailos, Kilmaresh has a warm, dry climate. The temperatures are very high, especially in summer, and it does not rain much. However, the island is not plagued by the lack of water that crusts the lakes and rivers of Krailos with salt. There is the big river Nykri, which rises in the mountains and its shores are very fertile. Therefore the capital Issavi was built in its fork. In addition, there are always oases in the steppe, which house smaller settlements or stations for travellers.

       East of the strait that separates Kilmaresh from Krailos, there are mainly dry steppe regions. At the peninsula's centre lies a large mountain range and one will always discover small oases and tombs scattered over the steppe. In addition, there are many rock formations, intervened with a rare blue ore, Tagralt, that has magical properties and cannot be found anywhere else in Tibia.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Issavi
       </strong>
       is a splendorous city with magnificent temples, palaces and government buildings, five to six stories high and built up in stages. The buildings are made of solid stone, mostly beige-yellow sandstone and look massive and edgy.

       One of the cityscape's defining features are the colours red and blue. Red or orange represents the sun god Suon and blue the sea goddess Bastesh. Statues of these two deities can be found in many parts of the city, as well as portraits of Anuma. The city has a large marketplace as well as smaller shops on the ground floor of some houses. Overall, Issavi is prosperous, lively, clean and imposing.
