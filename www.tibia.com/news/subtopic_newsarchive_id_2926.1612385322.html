      ith today's server save, we implemented a few content fixes and changes, for example:
      <ul>
       <li>
        We fixed an issue with the display of the current character's speed in the character profile in the Tibia Flash client.
       </li>
       <li>
        It is now possible to use all runes on Dawnport via the action bar in the Tibia Flash client.
       </li>
       <li>
        Items cannot be thrown back to Dawnport and NPC Inigo does not allow you to bring vocation sets and other items to Rookgaard anymore. In addition, some other Dawnport issues have been fixed as well.
       </li>
       <li>
        Lava fields should now work as intended.
       </li>
       <li>
        Also, some other graphic as well as map bugs, and typos have been fixed.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Please note that a new client version is available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.59 from our
      download section
      .
