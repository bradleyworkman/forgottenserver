        The setting: Retro Open PvP Without Skull System
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>

       The PvP setting will basically be that of Retro Open PvP but without a skull system. This means you will be able to induldge in unlimited player killing.
       <br>
       Also, there will be no fair fight rules, no Twist of Fate blessing and no differently coloured PvP frames. Check the Auditorium for
       further details
       on Retro Hardcore PvP's rule set.

       <strong>
        The reward: XP for Player Killing
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       As an incentive to kill other players on Retro Hardcore PvP worlds, you can gain experience for a frag:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        You will gain experience if you kill a character whose level multiplied with 1.1 and rounded down to the next whole number is higher than your own level, e.g. a level 40 will only get experience if his opponent is level 38 or higher.
       </li>
       <li>
        The amount of experience you will gain is capped:
       </li>
       <ul>
        <li>
         For level 50 and above, the maximum amount of experience you can gain per kill is limited to 200% of your character's current total experience points.
        </li>
        <li>
         Below 50, the maximum amount of experience you can gain per kill is limited to 25% of your current character's experience points.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
        Only your first five kills of the same player during a server cycle (usually time period between two server saves) will grant you experience. Moreover, the amount of experience you gain gets reduced by 10% with each kill.
       </li>
       <li>
        Additional info
        on XP for player killing is available in the designated thread.
       </li>
      </ul>

       <strong>
        The challenge: Harsher Death Penalty
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The feedback we received from players interested in a hard and unforgiving PvP environment, especially after the introduction of two new blessings earlier this year, encouraged us to go one step further than originally planned. A constant sense of danger is crucial for Retro Hardcore PvP. It makes your heart rate go through the roof before you strike a sneak attack, it has your palms sweating and your mind racing as you enter the fray.
       <br>
       So in order to foster the thrill and challenge of Retro Hardcore PvP, the death penalty will be raised by 16% on these worlds.
       <br>
       <br>
       Make an impact on Retro Hardcore PvP!
