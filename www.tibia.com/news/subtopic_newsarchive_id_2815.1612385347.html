      ew products are available via the payment system!

      In the
      <i>
       Extra Services
      </i>
      section, you can now also buy an "Express Character World Transfer". This service may be of interest to you if you recently transferred your character to another world but would like to move it again without having to wait six months.
      <br>
      An express character world transfer can be used immediately, regardless of when your last world transfer took place. That is the reason why this service is more expensive than a normal character world transfer.
      <br>
      Please note that besides this noticeable difference, all other restrictions and requirements of normal transfers also apply to express character world transfers.

       If you would like to treat one of your characters to a new devoted travelling companion, check out the new section
       <i>
        Mounts
       </i>
       in the payment system. There, you can find a colourful selection of extravagant mounts at different prices.
       <br>
       Accompanied by a majestic desert king, you will make a grand entrance wherever you go. Charge into battle on a fierce jade pincer, stand your ground on a massive platesaurian, or terrify your enemies and unleash chaos astride a blazing nethersteed.
       <br>
       <br>
       At the moment, 12 different mounts are exclusively available via the payment system. So make sure to have a look if you are interested in complementing your character's appearance with one of them.
       <br>
       Once bought and assigned to one of your characters, you can ride it ingame whenever you want, no matter if you are a free account or a premium account.
       <br>
       <br>
