      oday, we have something special for you: a contest and a sneak peek all in one!
      <br>
      This year's winter update will introduce a new race to the game, and our current working title is:
      <i>
       rat men
      </i>
      . However, we are sure that Tibia's imaginative players can easily come up with more creative names for this race. Thus, we decided to run a contest in order to find a dashing name!
