       ood news, with today's server save, we have implemented new features to&nbsp;the Tibia 11 client.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>

       Compendium is a new ingame feature which offers you short ingame summaries of various Tibia topics, game features and content.&nbsp;
       <br>
       To open the Compendium just click on the designated button. It will shine golden if new entries have been added since you last opened the Compendium.
       <br>
       In the Compendium, you can click on a category to see the entries that are available in this category.&nbsp;If you would like to read an entry, click on the small arrow button to the right to expand it.
       <br>
       Please keep in mind that there is only a small set&nbsp;of entries available at the moment. Further entries will be added in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Random Hints:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We have replaced our "Message of the Day" display with a random hints system. From now on,&nbsp;every time you start your client,&nbsp;a random message containing&nbsp;useful information, security hints, excerpts from our manual or monster lore will be displayed below your login box.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Potion Casks and Potion Kegs:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We have added two new products to the Store as well, which will allow you to refill your empty potion flasks.
      </p>
      <table align="center" border="0">

           Potion casks can be placed in your house and contain enough magical liquid for 1,000 refills. Depending on your needs, there is a cask for each&nbsp;size of mana, health and spirit potion available. No need to drag hundreds of empty flasks to your local magic shop for their deposit. Just refill them in your home comfortably.
          </p>

           Potion kegs are aiming for refills directly on the battlefield or during long hunting sessions. They are smaller than their stationary&nbsp;equivalents and therefore hold only a total of 500 refills. Especially if you want to save some capacity, those little wooden barrels might come in handy since their constant weight equals only 250 of the corresponding potion type.
          </p>
         </td>
        </tr>
       </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
       All potions&nbsp;filled up from the new potion casks and kegs will be kept in the Store inbox of the character that used the cask or keg.&nbsp;
       <br>
       Once a cask or keg&nbsp;is&nbsp;empty, it will vanish into thin air.
      </p>

       Have fun with the new features,
