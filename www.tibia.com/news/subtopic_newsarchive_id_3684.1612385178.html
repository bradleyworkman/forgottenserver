      ith today's server save, we implemented a few fixes and changes, for example:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Jorge has expanded his stock of replica items. The following fansite replicas can now be exchanged for silver raid tokens: medusa skull, golden newspaper, bag of oriental spices, Imortus, encyclopedia, doll of Durin The Almighty, hand puppets, music box.
       </li>
       <li>
        The rift warrior outfit can only be worn by premium accounts.
        <li>
         The security warning for the following links will no longer be displayed in forum posts:

          <li>
           the trace routes trace-eu.tibia.com and trace-usa.tibia.com
          </li>

        </li>
        <li>
         We fixed an issue with the animation of certain objects in the stand-alone client where the first frame of an animation was skipped. The Tibia Flash client already displayed the correct animation of such objects.
        </li>
        <li>
         We fixed a bunch of map bugs, graphical bugs, typos and other minor text issues.
        </li>
       </li>
      </ul>
      Please note that a new client version is available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.97 from our
      download section
      .
