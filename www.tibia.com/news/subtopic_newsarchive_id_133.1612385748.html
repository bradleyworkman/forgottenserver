      he current silence from our side is the first sign for big changes in Tibia. We work intensively on two updates: the new client and new map areas.
      <p>
       For the further development of the new client, we would like to ask you some questions about your hardware and operating system in a
       survey
       . This information will help to optimise the client for your needs.
       <p>
        As indicated in the last news we will present a new big area for premium players with a new town, more monsters, and fantastic dungeons. Moreover some areas like Kazordoon have been reworked and enlarged. All players can encounter new secrets and challenges there.
        <p>
         Finally we want to welcome two new gamemasters:
         <b>
          Flattery
         </b>
         and
         <b>
          Ygrane
         </b>
         . Our team of
         gamemasters
         will watch and help the Tibian community. A big thank you to all of them!
         <p>
          Have fun in Tibia!
