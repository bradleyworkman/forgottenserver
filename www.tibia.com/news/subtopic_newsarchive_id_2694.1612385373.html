      ith today's server save, we implemented a new feature for both game clients. From now on, NPCs in Tibia are marked by small speech bubbles which help you to identify their tasks easily:
      <br>
      <br>
      <img align="left" height="18" hspace="4" onclick="window.open('http://static.tibia.com/images/news/talknpc_framed.png', 'talk', 'width=481, height=352')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/npcgeneral.png" style="cursor: pointer;" width="18">
       marks all NPC who you can talk to
       <br>
       <br>
       <img align="left" height="18" hspace="4" onclick="window.open('http://static.tibia.com/images/news/questnpc_framed.png', 'quest', 'width=481, height=350')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/npcquest.png" style="cursor: pointer;" width="18">
       marks all NPCs who can send you on quests
       <br>
       <br>
       <img align="left" height="18" hspace="4" onclick="window.open('http://static.tibia.com/images/news/tradenpc_framed.png', 'trade', 'width=480, height=352')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/npctrade.png" style="cursor: pointer;" width="18">
       marks all NPCs who are willing to trade with you
       <br>
       <br>
       <i>
        To see an example how the new marks look ingame, please click on the icons above.
       </i>
       <br>
       <br>
       NPCs who provide both, quests and trades, are marked by a flashing speech bubble which alternates between the icon for questing and the icon for trading.
       <br>
       It is possible to disable this feature in both clients. To turn it off in the Tibia Flash client, open the Status tab in the Options Menu and tick off
       <b>
        "Show NPC Icons"
       </b>
       . If you are using the stand-alone client, you can deactivate the NPC marks in your General Options.
       <br>
       Please note, that you will still meet a few NPCs that do not show any icons, no matter if you have this feature enabled or not.
       <br>
       <br>
       In addition, NPCs will now say all their text regarding a topic or keyword at once. That means that you do not have to wait any longer until the NPC has finished his talk to get all information about a certain topic or keyword.
       <br>
       <br>
       Together with this feature, we have also implemented a few content fixes and changes:
       <br>
       <ul>
        <li>
         We addressed a small issue with the Mend Broken Dreams quest on Roshamuul. It is not possible anymore to release more than 3 butterflies during one mission.
        </li>
        <li>
         Eruaran now hands out the right addons when asking him for the mask and the claw.
        </li>
        <li>
         Dream matter will now be removed correctly during the umbral creation process of crude umbral axes at Eruaran.
        </li>
        <li>
         The world change Thornfire works again as intended. It is now possible to change the status of this world change again by extinguishing enough fire.
        </li>
        <li>
         It is not possible any longer to use dice on depot lockers and the counter between the lockers.
        </li>
        <li>
         In addition, some map issues have been fixed as well.
        </li>
       </ul>
       Last but not least, some PVP fixes have been implemented on both preview worlds for testing:
       <ul>
        <li>
         It should not be possible any longer to use blocked summons in PVP to trap people in a stack. The summons can now be killed by the trapped players.
        </li>
        <li>
         Another issue where a player could get a skull while defending himself in Dove mode has been fixed as well.
        </li>
        <li>
         Also, we addressed some minor technical PVP issues.
        </li>
       </ul>
       Together with the content fixes and changes, a new client version will be available.
The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.36 from our
       download section
       .
       <br>
       <br>
       Have fun!
