        In order to save me some gold coins, I accepted this new offer from Captain Charles to take me from Port Hope to Edron for a cheaper price.

        "It might get a little windy on this route" he said. "But nothing to be really worried about" he said.
        <br>
        Great... I am pretty sure that we faced the biggest storm known to mankind... and now I'm sitting here, stranded on this island.&nbsp;

       Day 5:
       <em>
        I have seen the suns rise and set four times already and yet I am still stranded. Yesterday, I found an old scroll in a chest, its purport is vague&nbsp;and it seems to be only one piece of a way bigger puzzle... Interesting. I wonder if somewhere else...
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        No, now is not the time to rack my brain for that. I need to focus on my mission. The scroll's secret will fill another page in my diary someday but right now,
       </em>
       <em>
        &nbsp;I need to get to Edron. There is a broken raft on this forsaken island. If only I could find a way to fix it....&nbsp;

        those towering walls, you can find the most honourable knights in Tibia and here is where it all started. It is their place of origin. I can feel it!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Those ancient castle ruins in the north must have been their stronghold. It all makes sense. All these years of research, of doubt, of setbacks will finally pay off.&nbsp;
       </em>
       <em>
        Their castle was there, the whole time, deeply carved into the mountain providing all the clues needed to find out what happened, we just need to look closer.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        I am curious to find out what awaits me in this mountain fortress. If any kind of hint or evidence is hidden in there, something about Ravus, something about the other side, whatever it is, I am the one who is going to find it.&nbsp;
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        However, before I do that, I will have to talk to those honourable knights in the city. Someone around here has to know more about them. I need to find the ancestors of those who witnessed what happened that night. The night, the Order of the Falcon disappeared...
