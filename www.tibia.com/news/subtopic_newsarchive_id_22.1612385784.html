      he server is now down for preparing the Christmas update. As we have to install the new map and to do some final tests, it will still take some hours. Please do not try to log in and disturb our testing. Otherwise your account will be banished automatically, and you will miss the update!
      <br>
      <br>
      Instead, we recommend you to spend the spare time checking out our website. Have you already read Knightmare's story about
      Tibia's genesis
      ?
Perhaps you are also interested in our project's history and future. In the library, you can already have a look at the
      new creatures
      that will come with the update. Last but not least, you should visit the
      voting page
      and take part in the election of the new Tibian Council.
      <br>
      <br>
      Have a lot of fun out of Tibia while we are working hard to get everything ready for the update!
      <br>
      <br>
      See you in Tibia in a few hours!
