      re you keen about the new client? Today we are starting a public testing phase, so that all of you can get some impressions of the redesigned layout, the revised graphics library, and new features like the chat system with different channels, the safe trade dialog, the VIP list, and the installation program. Have a look at the
      manual
      for more information about the new controls and where to obtain the new client.
      <br>
      <br>
      This testing phase is intended to give you a first impression of the new client and for us to get some feedback on how you find the new look and feel and whether you have any difficulties to install or run the program. Please use only the threads we have started on the proposal board for feedback. We will read your replies there carefully, but we might miss something you post elsewhere.
      <br>
      <br>
      For the test server we have taken a copy of the game world Antica last Friday. Therefore only players from Antica can take part in the test. Also, it is not possible to create new players. The map has been limited to Rookgaard and the surroundings of Thais. All inventories and depots have been deleted in order to avoid excessive rune shootings in the towns. Instead we ask you to play seriously, to use the new features just like you would use them in the regular game and not to disturb other players while they are testing something. The Tibia rules are also applicable for the test server. If you are violating them, you will be excluded from the test and also from the regular game.
      <br>
      <br>
      This testing phase will last until after next weekend. Afterwards, we will implement the still missing features (e.g., online help and automated client updates) and process your feedback. After another testing phase we will switch the regular worlds to the new client. We hope to do this by the end of August. Finally, we want to express our thanks to Mantus and Lord Ariakas, who have re-drawn and animated dozens of creatures. Mantus even provided us with a new title screen. Moreover we say thanks to our gamemasters and counsellors for testing the new client and discussing the new features.
      <br>
      <br>
      Happy testing!
