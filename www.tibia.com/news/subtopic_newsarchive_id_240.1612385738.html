      t is Christmas again and like every year we present a major update. All you need to do is to start your Tibia client. The update will be installed automatically. Please note that you should not use a changed graphics library for your client or the patching of the client will fail. If the automatic update does not work for you, you can also download the complete client from our
      website
      .
