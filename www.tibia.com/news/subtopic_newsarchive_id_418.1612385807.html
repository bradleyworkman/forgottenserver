      he beta test for our new Linux client is finally over and we would like to thank all participating players for helping us to test the new client. After a few last bug fixes, the client is ready for the regular game service.
      <br>
      <br>
      We are happy to announce that the Linux Tibia client is now available and can be
      downloaded
      from our website. Please note that it is necessary to download the client completely from our website since there is no patch for the client of the beta version available.
      <br>
      <br>
      Enjoy playing under Linux!
