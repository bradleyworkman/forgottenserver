       The current housing system will be enhanced soon and a bunch of new features will be implemented to improve your housing experience. There will be another teaser in due time detailing said new features. Furthermore, some houses which have been vacant on most worlds will be merged into bigger dwellings. Therefore, the rent for these houses will be increased. We've created an exhaustive
       list
       of houses involved, complete with location, the changes that will be made and the future rent.
      </p>
      <p>
       This change will take place at the earliest in 30 days and will be implemented before the winter update, being independent from it. The website's housing section shows houses which will be vacated as "scheduled for renovation". Any items left in them will be moved automatically to their owner's depot's inbox.
