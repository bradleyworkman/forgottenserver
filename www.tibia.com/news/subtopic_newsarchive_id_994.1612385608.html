      re you ready for a sneak peek at this year's summer update? We hope our weekly update teaser series, starting today, will help to ease your waiting time. We have some exciting things to share with you so let's get going.
      <br>
      <br>
      Even though there will be no new city this time, we do have some eye candy for you today. Tibia's highly skilled craftsmen and builders have done a fantastic job in rebuilding Carlin. The city will be an emblem of female elegance and taste with the smell of history in the air: steeply pitched roofs, elaborate timber-framed buildings, imposing statues and the lush greenery of parks all add to Carlin's medieval and venerable charm. To provide more convenience, the bank and the depot have been united in one big room with more entrances and exits.

      In harmony with the characteristic architecture of the city centre, Carlin's castle will shine again in all its glory, celebrating the legend of its female rulers. On the bas-relief castle walls, the banners of Carlin will be fluttering in the wind, bearing memories of the past and holding out hope for the future.
      <br>
      Several houses and guild halls in Thais and Edron as well as Edron's mighty castle have also undergone some renovation.
      <br>
      <br>
      In addition, a couple of new hunting grounds will be added. Near Beregar, beholders and gozzlers will be lurking in a dark cave. The Liberty Bay mountain has been occupied by behemoths, wyrms, nightstalkers and giant spiders and will be quite challenging even for experienced Tibians.
      <br>
      A dungeon with amazing underground waterfalls has been discovered under the south-western part of Tiquanda. Dim light emanating from blue crystals creates a unique mystic atmosphere. But don't be misled by the tranquility of the place, this area is infested with water elementals.
      <br>
      North of Darashia dragons and dragon lords will burn the ground in a new dungeon with their massive breath of fire. Will you be brave enough to face these vicious beasts?

      <br>
      Also, several existing hunting grounds have been revamped. Be prepared to encounter zombies and crypt shamblers in the refurbished Treasure Island dungeon. Demona, the Ankrahmun tombs and the Laguna tortoise dungeons will also appear in a spiced up look after the update. Moreover, adventurers can now use underground passages between the tarantula caves in Tiquanda.
      <br>
      All these new and revamped hunting grounds will be worth a visit. The loot of some of the aforementioned monsters will be improved so a hunting session may turn out more profitable after the update than you expect.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>
       Please note
      </b>
      : With the summer update, it will be necessary to empty all houses in
      <b>
       Carlin
      </b>
      (including Northport and Senja),
      <b>
       Thais
      </b>
      (including Greenshore and Fibula) and
      <b>
       Edron
      </b>
      (including Cormaya). This also applies to guild halls in and around Thais and Carlin. All items will then be moved automatically to the depot to which the house belongs. Of course, they can also be removed manually by the house owner. There are still a few weeks left until the update will be launched. Nevertheless, we recommend you to postpone redecorating on a grand scale until the update is here.
