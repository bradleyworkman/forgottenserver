       you ready to find out more about the Astral Shapers, to imbue items with temporary effects, and to pray for prey? The private test of the winter update has started and lots of new stuff is waiting to be tested!
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides the new content and features we already presented in teasers, the winter update will also bring along the following improvements:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
         With the upcoming winter update, we want to make gold payments more convenient for all players. Therefore,
         <strong>
          Tibian bank transfers
         </strong>
         will also work for free accounts from then on. If you spend gold at an NPC (e.g. for items, boat ride, arena access), via the market, the imbuing window, or the prey window, the gold will first be deducted from containers in your inventory, then from your Gold Pouch (if you bought one for your character), and finally, from your bank account.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
         <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">
          Improved
          <strong>
           character view
          </strong>
          in account management: If your character owns a house or is a member of a guild, you will see this information displayed below its name in the character list in your account management. The guild name and the house will be clickable links that lead you to the corresponding page in the community section of the website. Your guild and house will also be displayed if you click on "Edit" to see and edit details about your character. Additionally, you will be able to see all of your character's guild applications listed there.
         </span>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
         <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">
          Last but not least, you will be able to
         </span>
         filter
         <strong>
          highscores by vocation
         </strong>
         . For example: If you are interested in checking the magic level of sorcerers only, simply choose "sorcerers" as filter when viewing the highscore list for magic level.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       For the private phase, tutors, senators, fansite representatives, former focus group members, former closed beta testers, and selected long-time players have been invited to join the test. More information can be found in the welcome thread on the
       test website
       . While only private testers may post on the test board, all players can read it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there will also be a public test phase so stay tuned!
      </p>
      <p>
       See you on Testa and Testera!
