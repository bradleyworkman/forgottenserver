      e have just finished the very first version of the new client which includes the most important features. The new client will not only have a redesigned layout and a revised graphics library but also several new functions.

      <br>
      Here are some of the new features:
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>
       Eight individual male and female character outfits
      </li>
      <li>
