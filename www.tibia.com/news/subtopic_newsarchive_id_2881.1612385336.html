       The
       <b>
        champion
       </b>
       outfit perfectly suits battle-hardened warriors who rely on their trusty sword and shield. Disciples of magic may prefer to wear the elaborate
       <b>
        conjurer
       </b>
       outfit next time they call on the elements. Those of you who are looking for a faithful companion who can also bare his teeth at your enemies may take a liking to the
       <b>
        beastmaster
       </b>
       outfit.
       <br>
       <br>
       In order to get a better idea of how these outfits will look ingame, head over to the
       <i>
        Outfits
       </i>
       section in the payment system and simply place your mouse pointer over an outfit to start a walking animation that will show you both the female and male version from all directions.
       <br>
       <br>
       Once bought and assigned to one of your characters, you can wear the outfit ingame anytime, no matter if you are a free account or a premium account. Please note that these outfits are purely cosmetic and do not bestow any benefits.
