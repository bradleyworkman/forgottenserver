      he spring patch is here! In last week's teaser, we already announced the
      main new features
      it brings along. Let us recall the major changes:
      <ul>
       <li>
        All players are now able to report character names they find disturbing. For more details on how this works, please have a look at the corresponding
        FAQ entry
        .
       </li>
       <li>
        Premium players can now enjoy two happy hours: Within the first two hours of stamina, which means up to hour 40, they get 50% more experience points.
       </li>
       <li>
        If a character has 14 or less hours of stamina left when killing a monster as the highest damage dealer, the loot of the monster gets destroyed.
       </li>
       <li>
        Besides several improvements of the bot detection tool, characters that are banished now get kicked out of the game within a narrow time frame.
       </li>
      </ul>
      In addition to the features presented in the teaser, some further changes have been made. Information about banishments will no longer be displayed on a character page from now on, no matter if the character is hidden or not.
      <br>
      Besides a couple of minor bug fixes, there is now a solution for the error that sometimes occurs when logging out. If the client tells you that you are already logged in with a character even though that is not the case, you will now just have to log in and out with the affected character to solve this problem.
      <br>
      <br>
      The patch will be downloaded automatically when you log into the game. If you should encounter any problems, you can alternatively
      download
      the new client 8.55 from our download section.
      <br>
      <br>
      Have a good time!
