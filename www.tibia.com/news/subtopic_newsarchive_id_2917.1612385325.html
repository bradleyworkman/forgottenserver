      ith today' server save, we implemented a couple of fixes, mainly to address some issues that were related to Dawnport. Also, players that were affected by deleted inboxes after the release of Dawnport or were still missing money for house transfers have now received their belongings back.

      Furthermore, existing and future owners of nethersteeds, tempests and flamesteeds can now enjoy still animations of their mounts. So even you are just standing somewhere with your mount without moving around, the flickering flames of your steed will certainly make an impression. If you are curious to see these idle animations for all three mounts, you can also check the mount section in the Tibia payment system.
