      ith today's server save, we implemented a few content fixes. For example:
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>
       Their Master's Voice: The mad mage will now spawn randomly at one of three different locations in the dungeon. Also, we addressed an issue that allowed players to seal the area off for other characters until the next server save. The world change now gets reset to its initial slime stage if there is no character in the dungeon that has gobbled enough slime to face the mage. Moreover, we addressed an issue with reappearing slime even though players had managed to clean the whole area.
      </li>
      <li>
       A couple of map issues and typos were fixed.
      </li>
      <br>
      Please note that a new client version is available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.53 from our

      Enjoy!
