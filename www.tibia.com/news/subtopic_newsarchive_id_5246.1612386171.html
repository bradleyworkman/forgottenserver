        When I awoke in the dead of night, I knew immediately that a nightmare had held me in its grips just moments ago. I could not remember one detail, not even a fleeting glimpse of what my eyes must have beheld in the tenebrous netherworld of dreams; no, were it not for my heaving body, drenched in sweat, I would have never known that horrors had hounded me in the small hours. Yet, I had certainty now and got up. Sleep was out of the question in my state, my thoughts racing to grasp anything that might have troubled me so.

        Do not take me for a fool that I would waste the opportunity for sweet slumber, only to be safe of childish fantasies which do not afflict us beings of flesh and bone. These last weeks I have slept little, and what scarce time I was given to rest, was perturbed by strange hauntings and outlandish occurences.

        Given that I was not one to indulge foolish notions of the supernatural, initially I shook it off as merely being under the weather. Over time however, after having done my fair share of research, I could not deny the greater truth: The ghostly world of the vast beyond was in flux, unsettled by events far above my comprehension. I would have to gather skilled folk who could assist me in my mission to fathom the dealings of the spectral realm, that much is clear. I will continue with my work in order to be prepared for the moment when able-bodied souls will find their way to me.
