       t is time for another round of fixes for the Tibia 11 client. Among others, we were able to address the following with today's release:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        After switching characters with CTRL+G, the message "Connecting to the Game World. Please Wait." is now displayed until the connection is established or you are&nbsp;sent back&nbsp;to the character selection.
       </li>
       <li>
        From now on, the server log channel gets updated every time a hotkey preset is switched.
       </li>
       <li>
        Trading with specific NPCs does no longer close backpack windows automatically.
       </li>
       <li>
        As originally intended, ingame bug reports can only be sent by tutors.
       </li>
       <li>
        An issue causing the Market fee to not being&nbsp;displayed correctly in the&nbsp;total price field, is now fixed.
       </li>
       <li>
        The icon "Hide Party Members" now filters only members of your own party in your battle list.
       </li>
       <li>
        Already logged off characters should no longer be visible in the battle list.
       </li>
       <li>
        Monsters that are no longer in your game window, should not&nbsp;be displayed&nbsp;in your battle list anymore.
       </li>
       <li>
        Changing to a higher container level while the container is minimised, does no longer result in an empty container window.
       </li>
       <li>
        Players can now enable "Use Native Mouse Cursor" in their general options to use a&nbsp;default mouse cursor.
       </li>
       <li>
        A mouse click to perform an action (e.g. backpack opening) while having additional mouse buttons pressed, is now working.
       </li>
       <li>
        Clicking on a channel name multiple times does no longer result in lower FPS. The FPS drop after switching channels should also be reduced noticeably.
       </li>
       <li>
        An issue causing a cooldown icon to stay coloured even after the cooldown ended, is now fixed.
       </li>
       <li>
        We made some small adjustments to the sell offer process in the Market interface. It now works the same as creating a buy offer.&nbsp;
       </li>
       <li>
        We adjusted the size of the Market interface and&nbsp;interchanged&nbsp;the position of the columns "Piece Price" and "Total Price". A variation of the given order is no longer possible.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Have fun!
