      ince the Tibian community is expanding quickly we need further account numbers. From now on account numbers may contain 6 or 7 digits. For this reason an update of the Tibia client is necessary. When you start your client a patch will be downloaded automatically. If you encounter any problems, you can alternatively
      download
      the new client from our website.

      <br>
      In addition to this client update we have also revised parts of our documentation. We have worked once more on the
      manual
      , the
      quickstart
      and the
      FAQ
      . They should now provide you with enhanced information. Moreover, you can take a look at the first illustrations by our graphic artist in the manual section on
      vocations
      .
