      was broad daylight and Amaro was taking a stroll through Darashia's bazaar when the first vision engulfed him. A cold darkness gripped his heart with sharp claws. The hustle and bustle in front of him blurred and gave way to a bizarre mix of images rapidly flashing before his eyes. Numerous voices echoed through his mind.
      <br>
      <br>
      Darashia. - A mysterious man. -

      "My friend?" Omur's familiar voice pulled Amaro back into reality. "I have fresh samples of sand wasp honey, my friend. How many can I get you today?" The last image from the vision had burned itself into Amaro's mind and left him speechless for a few moments. He felt shivery and cold despite the blistering heat in Darashia.
