      A few adjustments have been added to this event:
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li>
        We added the new
        reward system
        to the Mutated Pumpkin. Those who took an active part in the fight against the Mutated Pumpkin will be rewarded according to their participation during the fight.
       </li>
       <li>
        Furthermore, it is still possible to enter the portal after the Mutated Pumpkin was killed, and to skin its corpse with an obsidian knife to receive a second reward. Please note that you can only enter the teleport if you have
        <b>
         participated in the fight
        </b>
        against the Mutated Pumpkin and if you
        <b>
         either opened the loot bag in the dead body or your loot bag in the reward chest
        </b>
        at the Adventurer's Guild.
       </li>
       <li>
        We have also changed the look of the yummy gummy worms. They are now coloured.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Be strong and enjoy your pumpkin soup!
