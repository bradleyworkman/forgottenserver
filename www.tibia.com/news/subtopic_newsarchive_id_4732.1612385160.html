       et us take a look at what is going to be introduced next week! Since our Rapid Respawn events have been quite popular and well received by our community, most of the monsters in Tibia will soon respawn twice as fast. Permanently!

       In addition to the general respawn adjustments, all inhabitants of a game world&nbsp;will be able to donate gold in order to further shorten the respawn time for monsters living in&nbsp;a specific area. At each server save, the area with the highest amount of gold donations is granted that additional respawn bonus until the next server save. On top of that, a randomly selected second area will receive the respawn bonus on a daily basis as well.

       The Cyclopedia Map will now&nbsp;display&nbsp;the name of the area you are currently standing in, which should help you to identify the correct area&nbsp;of your favourite hunting ground. We have prepared an
       FAQ
       in the comment section to provide you with further information.
