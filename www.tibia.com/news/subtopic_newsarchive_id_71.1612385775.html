      s promised the update is online now - featuring many new areas, like Ab'Dendriel the town of the elves, the Ice Islands in the cold north of Tibia and the Fields of Glory. Additionally many things have changed in the known parts of the continent. So prepare yourself to find new mysteries and challenges everywhere!
