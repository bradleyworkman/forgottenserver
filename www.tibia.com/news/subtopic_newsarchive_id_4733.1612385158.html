       ellow Tibians,
      </p>
      <p>
       last week, we already
       announced
       the new improved respawn rates as well as the donation system to further reduce the respawn times of monsters in specific areas. As of today, those new features are now available in Tibia!
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides that, we have revised and advanced our prey system. In addition to the already known possibility to roll for a random list of nine monsters, you&nbsp;can now directly select your prey of choice for the price of five Bonus Rerolls.
       <br>
       Furthermore,&nbsp;the prey dialog now offers an option called "Lock Prey"&nbsp;which locks both&nbsp;your prey and&nbsp;its corresponding bonus. Similar to the already known automatic&nbsp;bonus&nbsp;reroll, this option will&nbsp;refresh&nbsp;your prey time every time it is about to run out&nbsp;while keeping&nbsp;the current bonus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the term "Bonus Reroll" no longer covers the whole functionality of those cards, we have renamed them to "Prey Wildcards" and increased the maximum&nbsp;amount that can be owned per character to 52.
      </p>

      </center>
      <p>
       Last but not least,&nbsp;we have implemented&nbsp;a new antialiasing mode called "Smooth Retro" which combines the smoothness of the already known antialiasing mode with the crisp and clear look of the pixel mode. This new mode is enabled per default when you update your client and can be changed in the advanced graphics options of the client.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enjoy the new features,
       <br>
       Your Community Managers&nbsp;
