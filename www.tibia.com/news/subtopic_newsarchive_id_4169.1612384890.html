        long awaited summer update has been released! We have gathered the most important&nbsp;facts and changes, which now await you in Tibia.
       </img>
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil cultists
       are among the inhabitants of Tibia! Living in secret old caves and ancient ruins, they hatch their sinister plans behind the protection of a dark force.
       <br>
       Infiltrate each cult and fight your way through their dangerous hideouts to stop their mighty leaders from spreading their&nbsp;devious lies and malicious intentions once and for all! &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be a&nbsp;druid, who might&nbsp;have some knowledge of their wicked machinations but unfortunately, he is nowhere to be found.&nbsp;
       <br>
       Maybe you will find trails of him if you keep searching&nbsp;for speaking animals, tired trees and grumpy stones. Try to convince&nbsp;mystical new creatures, which&nbsp;fell out of the world of dreams, that you are trying to help them only with the best of intentions. Discover a completely
       new culture
       &nbsp;on the magical peninsula called Feyrist and gather valuable insights on the evil cultists!&nbsp;

      <p>
       You are now able to watch the day go by, since a new
       day and night circle
       &nbsp;brings different shadings to your surroundings. Additionally, the new circle has an impact on several new places in Tibia. Depending on the time of the day, you are now confronted with new&nbsp;settings and monsters. Even some of the new NPCs are influenced by it and are only available during certain parts&nbsp;of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       The long-awaited
       analytics features
       &nbsp;give you a&nbsp;detailed&nbsp;insight into&nbsp;your gained XP, dropped loot, your efficiency and many more. Look up your current damage and health output in the Impact Analyser&nbsp;and trace your waste of runes, rings, amulets, food, ammunition and potions in the Supply Analyser, for example. A graph in almost every analyser widget displays your progress over the last 60 minutes. An expandable left side bar provides you with more space to position&nbsp;all the backpacks and widgets you need.
      </p>
      <p>
       From now on, a
       &nbsp;daily reward system
       &nbsp;allows your character to pick up free items at the daily reward shrines. Depending on how many consecutive days you have picked up your reward, there are special regeneration bonuses waiting for you that&nbsp;will allow you to regenerate your mana, health, stamina and soulpoints in designated resting areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each&nbsp;vocation can now evoke a&nbsp;
       powerful summon
       &nbsp;as a temporary companion&nbsp;during hunts or in PvP situations. We have also added new ammunition spells for paladins and revamped the promotion spells for knights and sorcerers.
       <br>
       Furthermore, we have added imbuement slots to formerly chargeable and enchantable weapons in exchange for the
       incorporation
       of both, the enchanting and the charging system, into our imbuing system.
      </p>
      <p>
       A new game world type is going to launch in the second week of August.
       Retro Hardcore PvP
       comes with our Retro Open PvP rule set, however, with a harsher death penalty, XP for player killings and no skull system! Only the strongest players will survive the bloodshed on Helera, Macabra and Tortura! &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Last but not least, we added a new feature called "Quick Login" to our Tibia 11 client. Quick Login allows a faster client start and login to the game. Please keep in mind that&nbsp;it might lead to temporary invisible game graphics if you are using slow hardware. You can disable the feature in your graphics options whenever you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we have made many further adjustments&nbsp;during the test server, the teasers might not contain all the final information. Therefore, we have prepared a
       short summary
       of the most important changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We hope you enjoy the new content and features!
