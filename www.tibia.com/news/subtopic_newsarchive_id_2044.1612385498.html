      ith today's server save, we released a small client patch to address a few issues, for example:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Characters can now always log out in a protection zone regardless of whether or not the logout block is active.
       </li>
       <li>
        Orockle who now also gives information about the status of the Hive world change when asked about "news" or "status".
       </li>
       <li>
        The speed boost of the depth galea helmet now works correctly.
       </li>
       <li>
        New graphics for each of the four enchanted versions of the barbarian axe have been added.
       </li>
       <li>
        Several small issues with new fansite items have been fixed.
       </li>
      </ul>
      We also fixed a couple of issues in the Beta Flash client, for example: the spell list now updates correctly when the filter or sort mode is changed. Also, we fixed a bug with mouse look in classic controls and addressed an issue which caused a crash of the Beta Flash client when displaying a tool tip for the L1 action button.
