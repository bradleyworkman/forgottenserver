           This demonic inferno, filled with perishing energy and many-limbed creatures, will trap any unsuspecting soul trying to reach the end by rushing straight through. You may survive the first instance and, unlikely as it might be, even escape the second one by the skin of their teeth, but abandon all hope should you think of prevailing a third time, only to confront the lord of this domain.

Blessed by unspeakable evil, the blood of the creatures inhabiting this place is harmful to the touch and should be avoided, while their energy is needed to eventually face certain doom.

           The most twisted of places. What a cruel joke it is to have to fight in your own home, warped beyond reason but not recognition, all the while staring into familiar faces, having to fight friends and companions to the death. A chilly wind howls through the ruined streets and what should be sacred ground has taken on cursed form. By the time you reach the final fiend you no longer care whether you live or die.
