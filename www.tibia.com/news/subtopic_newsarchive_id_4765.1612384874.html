       a place full of peaceful creatures living in a perfect symbiosis.
       <br>
       A place without envy but with a thriving and prospering community, isolated and protected from any danger or negative influences.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may sound too good to be true but I know that such place had once existed.
       <br>
       It must have felt like a dream come true.

       nothing would have ever changed if he had not left us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he had stayed with us, keeping everything in balance... Who knows if the poisonous seed had ever sprouted its pesterous roots.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he abandoned us, his very own creation, and the emptiness he left filled with rivalry and resentment.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are divided, torn apart, nothing but fierce opponents and untrusting enviers.

       once loyal and united tribe of dreamborn is no more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, it is too late. What has happened can never be undone. Both sides should know better, but they are obsessed with its force and thirst for the strength of this nightmare.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will blindly steer their own people into doom and darkness... AGAIN!
      </p>
      <p>
       The prison walls are already crumbling, soon the beast will break loose.

      </p>
      <p>
       Once the beast has escaped its chambers, its sinister&nbsp;outgrowths will&nbsp;relentlessly roam through&nbsp;every corner of the Dream Labyrinth, searching for&nbsp;a way out. The seven doors will never withstand such brute evil force. They will burst&nbsp;wide open and&nbsp;the courts will fall.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it really have to come to that? What has become of this once so beautiful place? Please, help us! Please, wake me up!
