        the last teaser for this year's summer update we would like to present you a new Cyclopedia feature. Since the test server will already start in a few hours, we will focus on a short overview.
       </img>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the upper right corner of your client interface you will find a button that will open the new feature: The
       <strong>
        Cyclopedia Map
       </strong>
       !
      </p>
      <p>
       You can choose between two different display modes. The
       <em>
        Surface View
       </em>
       provides an in-game graphic display of Tibia's surface and all layers (floors) above. The
       <em>
        Map View
       </em>
       provides the classic minimap view. Layers that are situated below Tibia's surface will always be displayed in the
       <em>
        Map View
       </em>
       .

       The Cyclopedia Map is subdivided in different areas and subareas. Areas always describe a larger territory of land mass such as
       <em>
        Thais
       </em>
       . Within this area, there are different subareas such as
       <em>
        Thais City
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        Thais Surroundings
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        Thais Trolls' Cave
       </em>
       to stick to our example.

       subareas of an area can be discovered. Select the respective subarea name by mouse click and press the "
       <em>
        Start Discovering
       </em>
       " button.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several
       <em>
        Points of Interest
       </em>
       will now be randomly placed in the selected subarea. You will have to find at least seven of them in order to discover the subarea completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those points are only visible in the game window of the respective character and can be reset if required.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have fully discovered enough subareas, you will unlock new useful functions of the Cyclopedia Map:
      </p>
      <p>
       If
       <img align="left" height="305" hspace="10" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/outfit_discoverer.jpg', 'Discoverer Outfit', 'width=568, height=692')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/outfit_discoverer_small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer;" vspace="0" width="250">
       you have fully discovered at least 30% of all subareas of an area, locations of NPCs within that respective area will be shown on the map.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a minimum of 70%,
       <em>
        passages
       </em>
       to subareas on other map layers and teleports are displayed as stair symbols on the map.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once all subareas of an area have been discovered, creatures that occur in those subareas are listed when you click on a subarea's name or on a
       <em>
        passages
       </em>
       symbol that leads to this subarea. Creatures for which the Bestiary entry has not yet been unlocked are displayed as a silhouette.
       <br>
       In addition, a player who has completed an area will be notified whenever a raid is about to take place in that area within the next hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might want to pay a visit to NPC Charos from time to time since players who have completely discovered 10 areas can look forward to a new outfit. Discovering 15 and 20 areas unlocks the first and second addons respectively.
