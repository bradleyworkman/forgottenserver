      ith this year's spring patch
      <img align="right" height="135" hspace="4" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/spring_patch_tree.jpg" vspace="10" width="135">
      we plan to address a couple of topics on which we continuously received feedback during the last years because they have caused problems for players or influenced their game experience in a negative way. Our second teaser focuses on one of the bigger ones: Lag and kicks ingame.
      <br>
      <br>
      Currently, if a player experiences a connection loss because of a local reason, such as a client crash for example, his character is not logged out immediately during a fight but only after 60 seconds. Due to the lack of control over the character during this time, a character's death often follows.
      <br>
      In addition to the already existing precautionary measure of a mass kick which is triggered if the connections to a certain amount of players are lost at the same time, the spring patch will add several new mechanisms to alleviate the negative effects of lag and kicks for players.
      <br>
      <br>
      If the server identifies that your connection is gone, the time it takes until your character is logged out will then depend on your vocation because each of them has different chances of survival. Druids and sorcerers will be kicked out of the game after 40 seconds, paladins after 50 seconds, knights and characters without a vocation after 60 seconds.
      <br>
      Also, if the server identifies a connection loss, your character will be ignored by monsters for 30 seconds. If your connection gets restored during this time, monsters will attack you again immediately. If you cannot reestablish your connection and your character is logged out so that you have to log in again, a new login mechanism will help to give your character a certain chance to survive such a complete kick.
      <br>
      <br>
      In general, from the spring patch on, a character will be ignored by monsters for 10 seconds upon login. However, the already existing delay of 10 seconds for area attacks and PvP attacks will be extended to all aggressive actions. So you will have some time to orient yourself but in which you cannot fight. As soon as you move your character or the 10 seconds are up, monsters will stop ignoring you. Please note that if you close your client in case of a connection loss but your character is not yet logged out while you try to log in again, this measure will only be effective twice in a row.
      <br>
      <br>
      Last but not least, a special icon in the client will be displayed if the quality of your connection falls below a certain threshold and seems to be laggy. If the client does not get any response from the server anymore, you will also be informed about it with a special icon.
      <br>
      <br>
      Soon, we will continue with our outlook on the content and features the spring patch will bring along, for example, measures to address trashing of depot boxes and houses, and trapping with level and quest doors.
