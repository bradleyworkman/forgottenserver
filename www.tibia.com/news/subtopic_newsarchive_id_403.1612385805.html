      ome minor bug fixes have been released today, among them the display error of Premium Account days in the client. A patch will download automatically when you log into the game. If you should encounter any problems, you can alternatively download the
      new client
      from this website.

      As already announced, we have now stopped accepting letters containing personalisation data to request a new recovery key. Please understand that we cannot process any letters that have not reached our office yet. In case you need a new recovery key, you have to request a letter for a small fee via the
      Lost Account Interface
      . The letter will be sent to the address that you have entered in your account's registration. For this reason, please make sure to register your account with correct data. If you have not registered your account yet, do so now!

      Finally, the handling of the automatic character deletion has been changed. Now all characters on free accounts are deleted if they are not used within a period of
      <i>
       n
      </i>
      months where
      <i>
       n
      </i>
      is equal to their level. Characters of level 20 or higher are no longer excepted. Also, once an account has not been used for 2 years all characters on it are deleted regardless of their level.
