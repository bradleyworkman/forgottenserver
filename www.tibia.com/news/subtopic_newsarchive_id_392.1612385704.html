      s promised, this week's update teaser will take a closer look at a few of the sailors' tales about the weird creatures that roam Tibia's new
      premium
      area, the mysterious Shattered Isles.
      <br>
      <br>
      Even though the landscape of the Shattered Isles seems peaceful and lush, the idyll is deceptive. Not all creatures are as harmless as the cackling seagulls. Many a shipwrecked sailor has been attacked by innocent-looking amphibians such as multi-coloured frogs or slimy toads. Even more dangerous are the thornback tortoise and the blood crab. The real scourge of the South Seas, however, are the fierce pirates. There isn't a seaman who does not tremble at the thought of spotting the dreaded black flag on the horizon, and few who had to face the ferocious marauders and the cunning cutthroats in combat have lived to tell the tale. Even more feared, however, are the bloodthirsty buccaneers and the vicious corsairs, who rose to lead their brethren by being the wildest and the most ruthless of them all. Rumour has it that some of these jackals of the seas are so evil that they defy death itself, continuing their cursed existence even beyond their graves!

      But this is not all! It is said that an evil cult has a number of hideouts on the Shattered Isles. There are stories of dark rituals and bloody sacrifices, but no reliable proof to substantiate these rumours has been found yet. A terrible reality, however, is the mysterious amphibian race called the quara. Long thought to be the product of a rum-dazed sailor's imagination, these weird creatures have made their presence felt by raiding Liberty Bay, causing mayhem and destruction.
