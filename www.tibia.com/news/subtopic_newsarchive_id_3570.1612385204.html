       been right in the middle of a hunting session when you suddenly noticed that you are running low on potions?
       <br>
       <br>
       If you know the feeling, our current potion sale in the Store may be of interest to you: All potions are currently available at
       <b>
        10-20% off
       </b>
       their regular price!
       <br>
       <br>
       This sale lasts for a limited time only. So grab those potions while they are marked with a sale banner in the Store to benefit from this special offer!
       <br>
       <br>
       Moreover, we implemented a few fixes and adjustments today, for example:
       <ul>
        <li>
         Chartan has stocked up his shelves: He also offers the new potions now. Gnomegica, on the other hand, no longer sells them.
        </li>
        <li>
         We finally persuaded Ferumbras to drop his staff if his mortal shell gets defeated.
        </li>
        <li>
         We addressed an issue that had a few characters trapped in Santiago's quest on Rookgaard. These characters have been moved to Dawnport and can continue their Tibian journey from there.
        </li>
        <li>
         Crystal tables can now be rewrapped properly.
        </li>
        <li>
         If you do not fulfil any of the required conditions to buy a certain product in the Store, you can now see which conditions you do not meet: Either place the mouse pointer on the corresponding product and wait for the tool tip to open or select a product and click on "Details" to check it.
        </li>
        <li>
         We fixed an issue that made it possible for paladins to buy knight exclusive health potions in the Store.
        </li>
       </ul>
       Please note that a new client version is available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.93 from our
       download section
       .
       <br>

       See you in Tibia!
