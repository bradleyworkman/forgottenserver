       We have gathered all the facts and proudly present to you the winter update 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever heard of a race called the
       Astral Shapers
       ? You have not? Well, that is not surprising&nbsp;since this prehistoric culture vanished from Tibia's surface ages ago. With the downfall of the Shapers their greatest good, their omniferous knowledge, got lost as well.
       <br>
       However, the existence&nbsp;of six ancient sites has been confirmed lately, meaning&nbsp;there is still a chance to regain this knowledge. Embark on a dangerous journey through these dungeons and face the degenerated descendants of this former highly cultivated species. Knowledge is power! Find it, gain it,&nbsp;and use it in your fight against the uprising dark forces.&nbsp;

      <p>
       To get&nbsp;access to the ancient sites, players need to rebuild a temple located in the north of Thais, first. Afterwards, you can&nbsp;use a powerful technique&nbsp;called
       imbuing
       , which brings us to the next big addition this update provides for the game. Players can use imbuing stations located all over Tibia to strengthen their weapons and equipment with temporary effects. Keep in mind&nbsp;that powerful imbuements have&nbsp;to be unlocked via quests first. Imbue your equipment wisely and teach your enemies the meaning of fear. They won't see it coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are also introducing the
       prey system
       which allows you to gain temporary advantages against certain monster races. A prey lasts for two hours of your hunting time and gives you a benefit over your selected monster you will not regret having. Up to three slots are available to roll for monster lists and respective bonuses against the monster you choose from each list. You can gain more XP&nbsp;or increase your damage output against your&nbsp;chosen monster. Damage reduction might also come in handy, as well as an&nbsp;increased loot chance.&nbsp;Find your perfect combination to make your hunting more efficient and enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last but not least, we improved the Tibian banking system. From now on,
       bank transfers
       can be used by free accounts as well.
       <br>
       Additionaly, we improved our website and added an advanced character view in the account management.
       <br>
       And do not forget to check out the new vocation filter in our
       highscore lists
       &nbsp;if you are interested in how your vocation performs. &nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       That's it! Log in and try out&nbsp;all the new things by yourself!
      </p>
      <p>
