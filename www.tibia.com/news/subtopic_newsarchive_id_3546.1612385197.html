      must be good for something, right? It is! By mastering the challenges, you can collect gold tokens which you can trade in for completely new items. Items that can be charged with cool new effects!
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>
       New Items and New Item Effects
      </b>
      <br>
      <br>
      The new items, that will be available for each vocation, can be charged with the following new effects:
      <ul>
       <li>
        <b>
         Critical hits:
        </b>
        When charged, your item will receive a critical
hit chance and a critical extra damage value.
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Hit points leech:
        </b>
        When charged, your item will receive a hit points leech chance and a hit points leech amount value.
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Mana leech:
        </b>
        When charged, your item will receive a mana leech chance and a mana leech amount value.
       </li>
      </ul>

      The charges will only remain on your item for a certain period of time. You will be able to choose between 3 different types of charges for each effect, each type will let your item appear in a different colour. The types will vary in the duration of the effect, in the chance of the effect to trigger, and the extent.
      <br>
      These new item effects will also come into play when you are using spells and runes in order to cause damage.
      <br>
      <br>
      You will notice when one of the new item effects triggers during your fight. Also, you will be able to see your current boosts and effects in the Tibia client. Have a look at the following screenshots to get an idea of what this will look like:
      <table width="100%">
       <tr>
        <td width="50%">
         <center>
          <img height="143" hspace="15" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/criticalhit.png', 'crit effect', 'width=480, height=352')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/criticalhit_small.png" style="cursor: pointer;" vspace="15" width="195">
         </center>
        </td>
        <td width="50%">

        </td>
       </tr>
      </table>
      With this year's summer update, it will also be possible to find items that have more than just one skill boost, for example, a ring that boosts your main attack skill and shielding at the same time, or items that combine a speed boost with a regeneration boost.

      <b>
       Bank Transfers
      </b>
      <br>
      <br>
      For premium players this update will put an end to standing in front of a captain in order to travel, just to realise that you do not have enough money on you.
      <br>
      NPCs will now offer some form of electronic banking. If you want to buy something, they will first check your bags for cash. If they do not find enough money though, they will deduct the missing money from your bank account. You will receive an information about this in your server log.
      <br>
      NPCs are not able to add money to your bank account. So if you sell them your hard earned loot, the money will still end up in your backpack.
      <br>
      <br>
      Please keep in mind that all things are still subject to change, since the update is still in development. Especially when it comes to the item effects, the upcoming test server will help us add good values.
      <br>
      <br>
      Have fun in Tibia!
