      his week's update teaser deals with new quests. Many tricky riddles await all
      premium
      players in our amazing new area, the Shattered Isles.
      <br>
      <br>
      The Shattered Isles are full of mystery and adventure! Make sure to keep your eyes open when exploring them! You surely do not want to overlook a secret passage that will bring you to some remote place full of shiny treasure. Also, listen carefully to the stories of the island dwellers. Who knows, some of them might tell you about clandestine places or even better give you a tip on how to get there.
      <br>
      Everybody who has finished the Banuta quest should pay smart old Hairycles another visit. He might have a nice surprise for you if you find the right words. Also, if you were able to climb up the exclusive ranks of the explorer's society in the past, its members will send you on a very special mission this time. Maybe this diving helmet has something to do with it...

      Many of the new quests will reward you with more than trivial trinkets such as plain items or profane gold coins. The glory your characters' have earned will now show in their clothes. Young adventurers will surely greet you in awe if they see you walking around in your fancy new dress that tells about your heroic deeds. But - shush! We must not reveal too much yet. Perhaps you will find out more about this in next week's teaser.

      Have fun in Tibia!
