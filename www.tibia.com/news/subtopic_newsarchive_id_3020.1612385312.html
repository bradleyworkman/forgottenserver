      ith today's server save, we implemented a few content fixes and changes, for example:
      <ul>
       <li>
        We addressed an issue with the mission 6 of The Ape City Quest. Players can now obtain the needed item once every 24 hours by using "some witches' cap mushrooms".
       </li>
       <li>
        A small issue with NPC Perod and his trade dialogue has been fixed as well.
       </li>
       <li>
        Furthermore, the animations of some mounts have been adjusted.
       </li>
       <li>
        Also, some other graphic as well as map bugs, and typos have been fixed.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Please note that a new client version is available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.64 from our
      download section
      .
