       first he thought one of his mates had spiked his last beer at Frodo's for a laugh&nbsp;or that some evil witch had cast a spell on him but one thing he was certain about, this was not happening in his head.

       It was the druid, Gerimor was his name, who had divulged the alarming secret to him&nbsp;concerning the existence of covert&nbsp;cults all over Tibia. Cultists with evil intentions, some of them not even human, worshipping false gods and promises! They differ in ideology and goals and are unaware of each other&rsquo;s existence.
