        New Decoration Items
       </b>
       <br>
       <br>
       We have added new decoration items as well as furniture to the Store. You can now get a regular mailbox and an ornate mailbox for your house, several carpets, tapestry, lamps, as well as furniture bundles including a table, a cupboard and chairs in the same design from the Store. Individual furniture pieces are also sold separately. You can also buy pets as decoration items - just for display, no feeding necessary!
       <br>
       When bought, these items are directly delivered to you as decoration kits which can be unwrapped inside your house. The unwrapped decoration items are non-takeable and also indestructable.
       <br>
       <br>
       Please note that with this patch, all non-takeable pieces of furniture, not only these new Store items, can be re-wrapped again. Store items will be rewrapped into decoration kits, which will automatically go into your new Store inbox then, which we will explain further below. Other non-takeable furniture items will be rewrapped into furniture kits, which you will find in your inventory afterwards.
       <br>
       If the re-wrapping should happen automatically, e.g., if you lose your house, both, decoration- and furniture kits will end up in your regular inbox.
       <br>
       <br>
       Please also note that decoration kits and furniture kits cannot be traded in the market any longer.
       <br>

        Consumables
       </b>
       <br>
       <br>
       Further things were added to the Store with this patch. Apart from several runes, you can now also buy health, mana and spirit potions with Tibia coins. They are sold in stacks and come in the same sizes as they are available at NPCs.
       <br>
       <br>
       We have also added new larger health, mana and spirit potions to NPCs that sell potions in the premium cities. These larger potions are available in the Store, as well.
       <br>
       <br>
       Please note, though, that resources bought from the Store can only be used by the character that made the purchase, so please pay attention to vocation and level restrictions!
       <br>
       <br>
       In order to be able to buy such resources with Tibia coins, you may not have a protection zone block or an active battle sign, and you need to have enough capacity for your purchase.
       <br>

        Store Inbox

       From today on, all items that you buy in the Store are delivered directly to your new Store inbox, a container which you can access by clicking on the new Store inbox button, which is next to the Store button, right underneath your inventory.
       <br>
       The Store inbox does not have any limitations as to how many items it can carry, however, only the top 20 items will be displayed to you. To access the other items, you will have to take some out and put them either in your depot or your regular inbox.
       <br>
       Please note that items from the Store will always be either in your depot, your regular inbox, or your Store inbox. You cannot put them into your inventory, and they cannot be deleted or traded. And only items from the Store can be put into the Store inbox.
       <br>
       <br>
       The Store button, as well as the premium widget, have also been enhanced with some highlighting functions with this patch.
       <br>
       <br>
       For more details, please have a look at
       this post
       .
       <br>
       <br>
       A new client version is available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.92 from our
       download section
       .
