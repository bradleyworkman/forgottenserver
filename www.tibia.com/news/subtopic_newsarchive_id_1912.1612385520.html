      we are getting closer to the release of the winter update, and most of you have probably already spotted screenshots or even videos of the new content and features on fansites.
      <br>
      <br>
      Besides the market and the new island Quirefang on which you can face both the Deeplings in their underwater realm and the Hive Born in their buzzing colony, the winter update will bring along a whole lot of mini world changes. These small events and changes occur randomly all over Tibia.

      Let us hear what the famous towncryer of Thais has to say about it:
