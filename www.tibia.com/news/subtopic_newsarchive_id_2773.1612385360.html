       <br>
       We are now starting to work towards making Tibia available via Steam. Please understand that it will take some time to get all the details sorted out.
       <br>
       <br>
       As a token of appreciation, NPC Gaberiel will appear at Harbour Place in Thais with tomorrow's server save to hand out a green light to every Tibian who stops by and greets him. He will stick around for about two weeks.
