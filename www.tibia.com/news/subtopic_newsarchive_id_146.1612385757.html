      survey
      shows that there are many players that have no sufficient hardware to use the new client properly. Therefore we decided to support the old client beyond the coming update for a limited time. This is just a temporary solution to give the affected players time to upgrade their computers. Please note that the old client does not allow you to use all benefits of the new client features, e.g. safe trade.
