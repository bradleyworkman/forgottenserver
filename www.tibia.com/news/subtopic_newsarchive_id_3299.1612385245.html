      ith today's server save, we implemented a few content fixes and changes, for example:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Werebears no longer harm other monsters. Moreover, a melee-weakening spell of wereboars now correctly targets knights instead of paladins.
       </li>
       <li>
        We removed the limit to fight "Killing in the name of..." bosses only once every 22 hours on Retro Open PvP game worlds since it is not necessary anymore. A previous adjustment already made it impossible to kill these bosses countless times in a row through the use of field runes.
       </li>
       <li>
        We fixed an issue that made it possible to kill Deathstrike two times in a row.
       </li>
       <li>
        In addition, some graphical issues and map bugs have been fixed.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Please note that a new client version is available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.81 from our
      download section
      .
