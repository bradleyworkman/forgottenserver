      ith today's server save, a couple of things have been released. Here is a short summary for you:
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>
       A new Dawn
      </b>
      <br>
      From now on, new characters will start their journey on the brand-new beginner's island
      Dawnport
      .
      <br>
      In order to improve the testing of the different vocations and to give a more realistic preview of the individual fighting abilities of each profession, we recalculated the club, sword, axe, and the distance skill, as well as the magic level. That means that new, low, and untrained characters will notice a difference in the power of the skills named above. Nevertheless, the skill adjustment should hardly be noticed by characters with higher levels. All other skills remain untouched. Furthermore, new characters start with 55 mana points now. Therefore, 50 additional mana points have been added to all already existing characters.
      <br>
      <br>
      Also, please note again that along with Dawnport, a new PvP blessing for Open PvP worlds is now available. The Adventurer's blessing protects characters from any loss through a PvP death until they reach level 21. However, a character will lose the Adventurer's blessing if he attacks another player. The blessing cannot be bought but will be bestowed automatically upon all characters below level 21 that do not have a player kill in their history. A new icon in your inventory will show you if you are currently protected by this blessing.

      <b>
       It's a Kind of Magic
      </b>
      <br>
      In addition to the new island, we also added further improved animations to the game. New animated spells will renew the magic in Tibia. They will breathe new life into your fights and will make them appear more dynamic, or to put it another way: there is magic in the air. Besides the spells, further animations have been added as well.

       <b>
        To Hotkey or not to Hotkey
       </b>
       <br>
       Last but not least, it is now possible to use hotkey presets for the stand-alone client. Open your hotkey options, add, and edit as many presets as you want. If you name hotkey presets after your character names and enable the
       <i>
        Auto-Switch Hotkey Preset
       </i>
       option in the General Options the preset with the same name as the corresponding character will be activated upon login automatically. More information can be found in the
       manual
       .
       <br>
       <br>
       Please note that a new client version is available.
The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.55 from our
       download section
       .
       <br>
       <br>
       Enjoy!
