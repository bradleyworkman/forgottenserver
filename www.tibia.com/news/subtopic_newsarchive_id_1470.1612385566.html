      The autumn patch has been released! You can now enjoy the new
      PvP features
      that were developed with extensive input and feedback from the PvP focus group members. We are proud to have such passionate and dedicated people in the Tibian community and would like to thank them again for their immense efforts and contributions.
      <br>
      <br>
      In addition to the new PvP features, a good deal of new achievements are waiting to be discovered and earned. Last but not least, the reporting system has been upgraded so that illegal guild information can now be reported directly to our customer support team via the guild page.
      <br>
      <br>
      The patch will be downloaded automatically when you log into the game. If you should encounter any problems, you can alternatively
      download
      the new client 8.62 from our download section.
      <br>
      <br>
      See you in Tibia!
