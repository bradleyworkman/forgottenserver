      urrently, some players cannot trade midnight shards for experience with Lucius even though they have not yet traded the maximum of 40 shards this year.
      <br>
      We will address this issue with a small patch that will be released with tomorrow's server save.
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>
       After the patch, all characters who already traded midnight shards for experience with Lucius this year, can trade up to another 40 shards for experience with him this year.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
       All characters who have not traded any shards with Lucius this year are advised to take as many shards as possible with them before they say "hi" to Lucius next time after the patch. They can trade up to 40 shards with Lucius in that conversation. In addition to that, they can also trade up to another 40 shards with him this year.
      </li>

      We are sorry for the inconvenience!
