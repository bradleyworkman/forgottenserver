       <br>
       Following up a rumour I have heard in Port Hope's tavern, I shouldered my machete and set out again junglewards. Clyde's guests told me about a group of huntsmen, led by a man called Arthom. Unfortunately, nobody could tell me what those hunters are actually doing in the jungle.

       My curiosity was sparked.
       <br>
       Anyway, I was not able to find the place they have described to me. Instead of a hunter camp, I found a small settlement of dworcs, celebrating their strange fetish... Of course, they tried to capture me but they failed... thanks to my sword... Nevertheless, I really wonder where I can find those hunters or when...
