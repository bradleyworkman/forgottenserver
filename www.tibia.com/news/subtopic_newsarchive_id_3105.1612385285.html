      ith today's server save, we implemented a few content fixes and changes, for example:
      <ul>
       <li>
        The requirements to open the Dark Grounds in Roshamuul have been adjusted to make it easier to gain access to the area.
       </li>
       <li>
        An issue with the spawn of Gaz'haragoth has been fixed. He spawns now as intended.
       </li>
       <li>
        Unreachable wall decorations behind depots in guild halls have been sent to the inbox of the guildleader.
       </li>
       <li>
        In addition, some graphical issues and typos have been fixed and adjusted as well.
       </li>
       <li>
        Last but not least, it is now possible to use hotkeys in the stand-alone client to equip your character.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Please note that a new client version is available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.76 from our
      download section
      .
