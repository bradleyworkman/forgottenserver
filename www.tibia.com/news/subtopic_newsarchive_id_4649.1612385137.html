       Influenced by the new environment and climatic changes, the fur of the
       <strong>
        Ebony Tiger
       </strong>
       , the
       <strong>
        Feral Tiger
       </strong>
       and the
       <strong>
        Jungle Tiger
       </strong>
       has developed its extraordinary colouring over several generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once bought, your character can use the mount ingame anytime, no matter if you are a free account or a premium account.
