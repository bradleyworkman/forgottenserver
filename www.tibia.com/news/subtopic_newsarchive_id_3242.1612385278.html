      ith today's server save, we implemented a few fixes and changes, for example:
      <ul>
       <li>
        From now on, both Tibia clients will try to connect to the game server up to ten times automatically upon login before players will get the message, that the client cannot connect to the game server.
       </li>
       <li>
        Furthermore, the issue with the failing upload of guild logos has been fixed.
       </li>
       <li>
        In addition, some graphical issues, map bugs and typos have been fixed and adjusted as well.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Please note that a new client version is available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.79 from our
      download section
      .
