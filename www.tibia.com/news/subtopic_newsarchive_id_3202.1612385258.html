       <br>
       While I was wandering through the jungle, I met a man with the name Tarun who asked me for help:
       <br>
       <br>
       "My brother is missing. I fear, he went to this evil palace north of here. A place of great beauty, certainly filled with riches and luxuries but in truth it is a threshold to hell. Demonesses are after his blood. He is my brother, and I am deeply ashamed to admit, but I don't dare to go there. Perhaps your heart is more courageous than mine. Would you go to see this place and search for my brother?"
       <br>
       <br>
       What kind of adventurer would I be if I denied my help to such a request? So I searched for that place and found it. It was, as Tarun said, a great and beautiful palace. Anyway, all I could find was an imprisoned dwarf who also told me that this damned palace is ruled by demons:
       <img align="right" height="135" hspace="10" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/updatetreesummer135x135.png" vspace="4" width="135">
       <br>
       <br>
       "...the so called asuri. They are demonic creatures who usually hide their faces and appear in the form of a beautiful woman. In truth, they are ugly and ill-favoured. And this palace is as foul as the asuri are."
       <br>
       <br>
       That was the cue. Hell was unleashed. I was incredibly lucky to escape...
       <br>
       Time to leave this cursed jungle. I will continue my exploration in the desert, east of here...
