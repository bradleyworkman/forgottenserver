       re you an avid hunter, diligently collecting Hunting Task Points to get your hands on some nice rewards? Or&nbsp;would you perhaps&nbsp;like to become one, but those prices seemed a little too out of reach?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then&nbsp;we have some good news, as we have made several improvements to the Prey Hunting Tasks:
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, you now have a free list reroll per slot at your disposal which is renewed every 20 hours after using the last one. Secondly, using a Prey Wildcard to get higher rewards now has a 50% chance to increase the reward by two stars.

        Previously the reward always increased by one star. Thirdly, the prices for all rewards you can buy from Walter Jaeger have been decreased (old price in brackets):
       </img>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Antelope mount: 145,000 (225,000)
       </li>
       <li>
        Falconer Outfit base: 100,000 (150,000)
       </li>
       <li>
        Falconer Outfit addon 1: 35,000 (50,000)
       </li>
       <li>
        Falconer Outfit addon 2: 35,000 (50,000)
       </li>
       <li>
        Bone Bed: 35,000 (50,000)
       </li>
       <li>
        Gold Hunter Trophy: 80,000 (125,000)
       </li>
       <li>
        Silver Hunter Trophy: 15,000 (25,000)
       </li>
       <li>
        Bronze Hunter Trophy: 3,000 (5,000)
       </li>
       <li>
        Hellflayer Trophy: 80,000 (125,000)
       </li>
       <li>
        Sea Serpent Trophy: 15,000 (25,000)
       </li>
       <li>
        Gozzler Trophy: 3,000 (5,000)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Players who have already spent Hunting Task Points get 35% of these points back when they talk to Walter Jaeger about
       <em>
        rewards
       </em>
       . The amount of spent points will be reduced accordingly. The corresponding titles have been adjusted as well so that fewer task points&nbsp;need to be spent to attain them (old&nbsp;requirement in brackets):
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Aspiring Huntsman/Huntswoman: 160,000 (250,000)
       </li>
       <li>
        Competent Beastslayer: 320,000 (500,000)
       </li>
       <li>
        Feared Bountyhunter: 430,000 (655,000)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Last but not least, from now on the daily reward on day 3 will be 3 Prey Wildcards instead of 2. The limit of cards a character can hold has also been increased from 52 to 53.
      </p>
      <p>
       Happy hunting,
