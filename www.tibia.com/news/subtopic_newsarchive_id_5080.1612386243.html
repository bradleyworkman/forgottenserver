        In short, with the coming summer update, you will have the possibility to create
        <strong>
         friend lists
        </strong>
        . Via a new dialog in the Tibia client, you can search for friends, invite them, group them and look at their account information. This information will include
        <strong>
         brand new badges and titles!
         <br>
        </strong>
        <br>
        Of course you will have the power over what information should be displayed to others, so do not worry, your hidden characters will remain hidden.
        <br>
        <br>
        Let's take a closer look:
       </img>
      </p>
      <p>
       <img align="right" height="180" hspace="10" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/charactersummaryfriendlist.jpg', 'friendlist', 'width=753, height=543')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/charactersummaryfriendlist_small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer;" vspace="10" width="250">
      </p>
      <p>
       With friend lists, you will be able to keep track of your friends regardless of the game world or character they are playing on, if they agree to it. With the name of the newly defined
       <em>
        main character
       </em>
       of an account, you will be able to invite friends and to sort them into different friend groups:
       <em>
        Close Friends
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        Friends
       </em>
       , and
       <em>
        Contacts
       </em>
       . Via your friend lists, you will see the online status or the last game login of your friends, the account status and loyalty title, and a list of all unhidden characters.
       <br>
       You will also be able to perform a character view that will let you see the complete character summary.
      </p>
      <p>
       On your end, you will have options to define what kind of information should be available for others to see. Apart from already existing information, you will also be able to choose settings concerning
       <em>
        badges
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        titles
       </em>
       which should be displayed to your friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are badges and titles, you ask? Let us explain:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <em>
         Badges
        </em>
        refer to accounts. You earn them by fulfilling different conditions. For example, there will be badges depending on the account age, loyalty points, the sum of character levels, or badges you have earned for tournaments. All your account badges will be displayed on your account page. You will be able to choose your settings for them via your account page, too.
       </li>
       <li>
        <em>
         Titles
        </em>
        on the other hand, refer to characters. You earn them by fulfilling different conditions with just that character. There will be temporary and permanent ones. These could be connected to monster kills in combination with the Cyclopedia, or quests you have done for mounts or outfits, the amount of ingame gold you have, levels you have reached, experience wise as well as skill levels, titles referring to your guild function, maybe, or titles that are connected to highscores, tournaments, etc. You will be able to choose your title settings ingame, via your own character view.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       What is this good for, you might wonder? Apart from this being a preparation for features to come in future updates, this new system let's you build a bit of a social network already and it offers you a way to show to your friends what you have been up to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course you will also be able to unfriend a former friend again, or to even go as far as to block someone from sending you friend requests if you do not get along anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       If somebody searches for your character via the website, and your character is not hidden, he or she will see the number of titles that your character holds in addition to your chosen title for that character, as well as your account badges, depending on your settings, and - of course, the information that is currently displayed already, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Please keep in mind that we are still in the phase before the test server, so all this is still subject to change.
       </em>
