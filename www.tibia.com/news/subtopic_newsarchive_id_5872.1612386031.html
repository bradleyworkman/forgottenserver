       he following things have been changed and fixed:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        We fixed two issues with Chivalrous Challenge: First, it no longer challenges melee fighters;&nbsp;instead, it now only challenges distance fighters and turns them temporarily into melee fighters, as originally intended. Second, casting Chivalrous Challenge without target no longer targets invisible creatures.
       </li>
       <li>
        To help lower level sorcerers and druids, their Magic Shield capacity&nbsp;has been&nbsp;increased. This increase in capacity is less noticeable the higher the character level is. Furthermore, the Magic Shield's capacity can no longer exceed&nbsp;a character's mana pool. The duration&nbsp;of the shield has been extended to 180 seconds.
       </li>
       <li>
        Expose Weakness and Sap Strength are now listed in the support spell category of trade NPCs.
       </li>
       <li>
        A bug which prevented some players from logging in after buying a character on the Char Bazaar has been fixed.
       </li>
       <li>
        Tibia now runs on macOS Big Sur, while&nbsp;the new&nbsp;minimum requirement is macOS Catalina (10.15). If you tried to play Tibia on Big Sur before, please download the client from the website again and reinstall the game.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Moreover, the loot and XP of the Furious Crater and Claustrophobic Inferno have been adjusted:
      </p>
      <p>
       The brachiodemon, infernal demon, infernal phantom, cloak of terror, courage leech and vibrant phantom now give 15% less loot. They also give 20% less XP: Brachiodemon (28600 &rarr; 22880), infernal demon (32500 &rarr; 26000), infernal phantom (28600 &rarr; 22880), cloak of terror (31200 &rarr; 24960), courage leech (29900 &rarr; 23920) and vibrant phantom (31200 &rarr; 24960).
