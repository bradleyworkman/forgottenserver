      he countdown to this year's winter update has started. From this update you can expect new areas with a new city, new quests, new monsters, new raids, new party features, and much more. From now on until the update, we will present you more detailed information on certain aspects of the update in our so-called Update Teaser series.

      Today we would like to introduce you to
      <b>
       Yalahar
      </b>
      , an ancient city that has developed greatly over time. Its inhabitants, the Yalahari, belonged to one of the most intelligent races that were created during the God Wars. They did not see any purpose in sacrificing themselves in this war, so they withdrew from the raging battles and found refuge on one of the northern islands.
      <br>
      There, they quickly established this city with the help of their minions and pursued their quest for knowledge and science. During their research, they stumbled across an entity that seemed to be living in a place that existed somehow between worlds, somehow between existence and non-existence. They decided to name this entity Variphor.
      <br>
      Their initial thrill to have discovered something that spectacular was soon replaced by fear. Variphor was vicious by nature and had gained enough power to influence the Yalahari in a negative way. He manipulated them to fight each other and in a night of slaughter many of them died. To avoid a complete destruction of what they had accomplished, the Yalahari fled from the island and left the city to their minions. Without their masters, they tried very hard to keep everything running. However, soon they were overcome with vanity, enjoying the luxury that now belonged to them. Some of the former minions even started to pretend to be the real Yalahari.
      <br>
      <br>
      Rumour has it that one of the true Yalahari has returned in the meantime though, influenced by Variphor, to bring destruction upon the world. So be careful whom to trust and try to find out if you are dealing with an enemy or a friend if you meet a Yalahari.
      <br>
      <br>
      The nine quarters that once formed Yalahar became pretty run down over time. Some were completely destroyed, others were invaded by criminals, so the former minions of the Yalahari had to retreat to the inner city.

      <br>
      Still today, the nine quarters of Yalahar can be recognised. Most criminals that have invaded Yalahar have gathered in the former
      <i>
       trade quarter
      </i>
      , which is located close to the harbour. From this location, arriving merchant ships can be observed closely and traders can be robbed easily - a perfect place for the evil-minded.
      <br>
      Immigrants of many different races live in the
      <i>
       foreigner quarter
      </i>
      . Orcs, elves, minotaurs, humans - all share this area, which is far from being peaceful, as you can probably imagine.
      <br>
      Many fancy machines and traces of secret sources of energy can still be seen in the
      <i>
       factory quarter
      </i>
      . However, all knowledge to use these devices has disappeared with the Yalahari.
      <br>
      The former
      <i>
       alchemist quarter
      </i>
      , the main area of science, looks as if it was destroyed by a major explosion. The ruins of the laboratories and the mutated creatures hint at the dangerous experiments that once were conducted there.
      <br>
      In the
      <i>
       cemetery quarter
      </i>
      , the dead have taken over completely and the former buildings and crypts now only serve as a place for necromantic rituals.
      <br>
      The
      <i>
       magician quarter
      </i>
      does not look as run down as the others, but it is inhabited by many dark and evil sorcerers. Once in a while you can still find a helping soul there, but you are advised to be very cautious if you want to visit this place. At one part of this quarter, the surface of the earth has broken open and creatures of hell try to come to the surface.
      <br>
      The
      <i>
       sunken quarter
      </i>
      was once part of Yalahar, but the entire area broke from the land and sunk into the sea, as the name already says.
      <br>
      The
      <i>
       arena and zoo quarter
      </i>
      once served as a recreation area to the Yalahari. Now, all animals run free, their enclosures are destroyed and former gladiators stray around the area mazily to find opponents.
      <br>
      Last but not least, the
      <i>
       inner city
      </i>
      , to which the minions had retreated, is the only part of Yalahar, which is considered to be safe. Many traders have settled in this calm and quiet place, and the few houses that can be rented in this part of the city reflect the former wealth and luxury that Yalahar once was blessed with.
      <br>
      <br>
      We hope that you will enjoy discovering the mysteries of this city. For further pictures, please have a look at our
