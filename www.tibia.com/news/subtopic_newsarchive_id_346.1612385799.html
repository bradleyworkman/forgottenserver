      n preparation for the Christmas update, some important technical adjustments must be made. For this reason all game servers will be offline today, November 16th, until 18:00 CET. Please note that this is not the annual Christmas update yet. You will hardly see any changes in the game. A noticeable adjustment we have made is the increased durability of spears, throwing stars and knives. Also, items or creatures that are roped up from a hole will now end up on the field the rope user is standing on.

      When you log into the game a patch for your client will be downloaded automatically. If you encounter any problems, you can alternatively
      download
      the new client 7.55 from this website or from some of our
      supported fansites
      .

      Please excuse any inconvenience due to the downtime.
