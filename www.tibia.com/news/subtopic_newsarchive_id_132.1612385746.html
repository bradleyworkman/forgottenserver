      e are making good progress on the new client for Tibia which will be released this summer. Information about the new client will be posted here soon. To shorten the time until the release, we are preparing new and improved map areas with many new dungeons and monsters.
      <br>
      <br>
      In order to secure Tibia's future we have to think ahead and investigate new technologies. Therefore we started a little experiment called "Tibia Micro Edition" which is basically a very simple version of Tibia for Java enabled mobile phones. Nevertheless it is a completely seperate game with a totally different world. Feel free to
      take a look
      at it.
      <br>
      <br>
      Of course you can be sure that good old Tibia has still top priority for us.
