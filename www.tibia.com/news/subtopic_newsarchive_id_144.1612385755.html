      oday we finished the first public test for the new client. We want to thank you for your help and all the good comments and suggestions.
      <br>
      <br>
      Please tell us if you could run the new client at acceptable speed in our current poll "Can you run the new client on your computer?"
      <br>
      <br>
      Of course you can still use the threads at the proposal board to tell us about your experience concerning the test. In the next time we will do further improvements at the new client and launch a second public test in about 2 or 3 weeks.
      <br>
      <br>
      Have fun in Tibia!
      <br>
