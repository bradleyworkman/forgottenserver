        Tibians,

       while the prices for potions and runes have not changed since their introduction, over the years newer and more profitable hunting grounds were introduced to Tibia. Therefore, there is a growing disproportion between the high purchasing power of players and the low prices of some consumable items.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to meet this increasing purchasing power&nbsp;on our game worlds, we have made some adjustments to NPC and related Store items of various consumable items with today's server save.
      </p>
      <p>
       Affected by the adjustments are all potions, exercise weapons, some runes and all casks and kegs.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have prepared a full list of all affected items and their new prices
       here
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Those changes are effective immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       See you in Tibia,
