       ith today's Tibia 11 client update, we addressed the movement issues we received feedback on from our community. The following changes have been implemented&nbsp;to make your character's movement as similar to the old stand-alone client as possible:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        We reduced the movement delay which occurred after changing floors&nbsp;via ladders or stairs, for example.
       </li>
       <li>
        Using potions or casting spells while walking is now working as in the old client.
       </li>
       <li>
        We fixed some issues which under certain circumstances caused stuttered movement and snap-backs while walking.
       </li>
       <li>
        Additional steps at the end of a walking command should no longer occur.
       </li>
       <li>
        If a movement key is still pressed while you release a modifier key, your character now starts walking in the desired direction.
       </li>
       <li>
        Key commands are now more responsive when&nbsp;pressed in close succession.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Further information:
       </strong>
       If you are moving via your numeric pad and experience your character to continuously walk in one direction even if you have already released&nbsp;the key, we highly recommend deactivating&nbsp;your numeric lock (num lock).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, we want to thank everyone who gave feedback. It helped a lot to address the issues. So please do not hesitate to provide further feedback if you are still experiencing difficulties.&nbsp;
      </p>
