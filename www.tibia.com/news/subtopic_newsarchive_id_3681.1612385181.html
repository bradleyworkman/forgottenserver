        XP Boost
       </b>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Increases experience points for killing monsters by 50%.
        </li>
        <li>
         Only applies to the character which bought the XP Boost in the Store.
        </li>
        <li>
         Automatically set to active after purchase and lasts for 1 hour of hunting time: Similar to stamina, the duration of the XP Boost will only be reduced while you are hunting. If stamina falls under 14 hours, the XP Boost will be paused as long as stamina remains below 14 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
         As long as an XP Boost has not been used up completely, no further XP Boost can be purchased in the Store.
        </li>
        <li>
         Between two server saves, every character can purchase up to 5 XP Boosts at most.
        </li>
        <li>
         The price for an XP Boost increases with every purchase between two server saves: 1st XP Boost = 30 Tibia Coins, 2nd XP Boost = 45 Tibia Coins, 3rd XP Boost = 90 Tibia Coins, 4th XP Boost = 180 Tibia Coins, 5th XP Boost = 360 Tibia Coins.
        </li>
        <li>
         Adds up with other XP modifiers such as double XP weekends, for example.
        </li>
        <li>
         Via the skill window, all players will be able to check their current XP gain rate and see which bonuses or maluses apply. The remaining duration of a bought XP Boost and the stamina bonus of premium players ("happy hours") will also be displayed there.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <b>
        Please note
       </b>
       : For the first one or two weeks, XP Boosts will only be buyable on the preview game worlds Aurora and Aurera so that we can make sure that they technically work as intended.
