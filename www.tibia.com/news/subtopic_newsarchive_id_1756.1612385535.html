      Go ahead, the Tibia summer update 2011 has just been released!
      <br>
      <br>
      New challenges and adventures are waiting for you, and your actions and decisions will matter more than before. Our update teasers already provided you with a glimpse on world changes but let us summarise the new content before you head out to explore and see for yourself:
      <br>
      <br>
      South-west of Zao Steppe, a
      raging mage
      has created a dimensional portal on top of a tower through which you can enter another dimension. Near Edron, the servants of a mad mage are following
      their master's voice
      and keep a dangerous slime fungus at bay.
      <br>
      If you are already close to Edron, you might want to side with one of the daemon races waging war against each other below Edron. It is up to you to tip the balance in
      demon wars
      .
      <br>
      <br>
      Shadowthorn
      ablaze? Indeed! A few rebellious elves have been imprisoned by the followers of a forgotten Bog god. If you help them to break free, they will set Shadowthorn on fire.
      <br>
      In the mines of Kazordoon, the entrance to the sunken "Eyes of the Deep" has been discovered. The area is
      awash
      with water, though, and you need to drain it if you want to get access. You can also find one of the two new steamship links between Kazordoon and Thais there. The other one is managed by a dwarven explorer who needs coal to keep his
      steamship
      service running.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you prefer the hot dry climate of the desert, you might want to explore
      Horestis' tomb
      near Ankrahmun. Destroy the jars that seal the Pharaoh's burial chamber to wake him from his eternal slumber.
      <br>
      Fishing enthusiasts should stop by the mysterious Lake Equivocolao in the north of Tiquanda. If the lake gets really dirty, you might be lucky and catch a
      shimmer swimmer
      , a rare fish that can transform into a piece of equipment, for example.

      The fur and antlers of the white deer of Ab'Dendriel's forest can be sold for a good price. However,
      overhunting
      these beautiful creatures will endanger them with extinction, and their natural enemies, the wolves, will roam the land driven by hunger.
      <br>
      In Venore, Ottokar is in need of medicine bags to keep the local
      swamp fever
      in the poor house under control. If you do not help him, the fever will spread to the city, and maddened feverish citizens will roam the streets.
      <br>
      West of Greenshore, occasional
      insectoid invasions
      threaten to turn the green land into brown wasteland if you do not interfere.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you plan to visit the new locations why not do so on the back of a horse? Just rent a horse at the
      horse stations
      near Thais or Venore. There is also a coach service available that connects both cities.
      <br>
      If you prefer to have your own war horse, though, you might want to try to tame a wild horse if they are on the loose. Speaking of taming, further new mounts can be obtained by premium players, for example: the crystal wolf, the tiger slug, the kingly deer, and the scorpion king. In addition, there are two new outfits that you can dress your characters in: the elementalist outfit and the afflicted outfit.
      <br>
      <br>
      Also, a whole lot of new achievements can be gained, and a couple of issues have been addressed as you can read in the
      Auditorium.
      Last but not least, a new questline will be available on
      Rookgaard
      which can be accepted by players up to level six. It will guide them till the Isle of Destiny, and help them to gain some useful knowledge for the things to come.
      <br>
      <br>
      The update will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also
      download
      the new stand-alone client version 9.1 from our download section.
      <br>
      <br>
      Enjoy!
