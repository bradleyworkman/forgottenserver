       After first
       announcing&nbsp;them
       &nbsp;back in October, we invited a large number of players to partake in testing these new and changed features we had come up with. During the test, we made a number of improvements based on your feedback and suggestions &ndash; thanks again to everyone who contributed constructively to the discussion and made helpful suggestions. Afterwards, we reviewed the vocation adjustments again internally, in the state they had been at the end of the test server. And now, it is time for the adjustments to be introduced to all game worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have created a
       list of changes
       these adjustments entail, separated by vocation where applicable. For the most part, they are the same as they have been at the end of the test. We have, however, decided not to implement the reduced spread of single target, non-critical physical attacks, which would have affected knights and paladins. After going through your feedback again, it became clear that the potential upside of raising the minimum damage would not outweigh the perceived downside of lowering the maximum damage, even though it would have resulted in no difference in the mean damage output.
      </p>
      <p>
       We appreciate constructive input and feedback regarding the adjustments. We have created four threads, one for each vocation, so please post your feedback in the thread it is most relevant for:
       Knights
       ,
       Paladins
       ,
       Druids
       ,
       Sorcerers
       .&nbsp;We are also aware that adapting or even innovating your hunting style takes time. Naturally, we are going to follow developments ingame closely and will make changes when necessary.
