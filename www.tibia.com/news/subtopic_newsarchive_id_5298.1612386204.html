        today's server save, the following house-related fixes and changes have been implemented:
       </img>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        House owners can now also use a bed's footboard to kick a sleeping character out. Moreover, beds can no longer be unwrapped in front of a depot locker.
       </li>
       <li>
        Beds that are stacked on top of each other can no longer&nbsp;be used&nbsp;to sleep and offline train. The same applies to beds placed on door fields. Occupied bed pieces on door fields&nbsp;have been&nbsp;cleared of their human remains.
       </li>
       <li>
        Beds can no longer be unwrapped on top of other impassable objects. Beds placed on such fields have been cleared and wrapped.
       </li>
       <li>
        We fixed an issue that prevented a guildhall transfer from working properly in a specific, rare scenario.
       </li>
       <li>
        The rent of the house "Stonehome Village 3", which was raised to 80k by mistake, has been lowered&nbsp;to 50k again.&nbsp;&nbsp;
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Further changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Urmahlullu has&nbsp;been adjusted to make the fight a bit more challenging.&nbsp;It cannot be cornered that easily anymore so be on your guard. Also,&nbsp;your participation during the&nbsp;whole fight is now taken into account for&nbsp;the distribution of&nbsp;XP and loot.
       </li>
      </ul>
