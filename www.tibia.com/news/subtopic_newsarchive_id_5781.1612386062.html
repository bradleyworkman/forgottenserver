       Today's patch fixes a bug&nbsp;which caused&nbsp;some NPC trade menus to open with an empty sell section. Another change that has been made is that&nbsp;when a player has posted in the Auditorium, they now can only post with that same character in the next 24 hours. If they want to post with another character, they have to wait 24 hours from their last post on before they can do so.
