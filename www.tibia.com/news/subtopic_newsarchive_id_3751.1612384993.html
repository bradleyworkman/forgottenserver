      ellow Tibians, we released another round of features for the Tibia 11 client.
We hope you enjoy the following improvements:
      <br>
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li>
        We restructured and enhanced an option's tab.
        <i>
         "Console"
        </i>
        got renamed to
        <i>
         "Messages"
        </i>
        and contains the options to
        <i>
         "Show Spells in Game Window"
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         "Show Spells of Others in Game Window"
        </i>
        now. Disabling these options should lead to a better visibility of your health and mana bars in various situations.
       </li>
       <br>
       <li>
        Furthermore, we made the command to turn your character more customisable. In the general options you can now choose if you want to use
        <i>
         Ctrl
        </i>
        ,
        <i>
         Shift
        </i>
        or
        <i>
         Alt
        </i>
        to turn your character. If you want to, you can also have two of the keys or even all three of them enabled at the same time. Please keep in mind that you might have to adjust your hotkeys to avoid an overlapping effect.
       </li>
       <br>
       <li>
        Last but not least, a minimap issue causing FPS drops while trying to move to unreachable places is now fixed.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Kind Regards,
      <br>
