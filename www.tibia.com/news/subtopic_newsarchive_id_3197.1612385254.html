       <br>
       That was a surprise. I was exploring the area north of Port Hope once again, when I sighted an iceberg at the shore. I have no clue from where it was washed up.

       Chakoyas are inhabiting this frosty island. Unfortunately, I did not explore the isle further because my equipment was not really fit for such a climate change. I really had not expected to find an iceberg amidst the tropics.
       <br>
       I will come back here but then well-prepared. Although, according to the citizens of Port Hope, the iceberg is not always there...
