      n our first patch teaser, we already introduced some of the changes that will come along with the spring patch that is planned for release next Wednesday, March 18, afternoon. But, we have more in store for you and would like to present you what else you can expect.
      <br>
      <br>
      As you probably know, the time that is left until a character is too tired to gain experience while hunting, is referred to as
      <b>
       stamina
      </b>
      . Until now, characters could hunt for up to 56 hours before they stopped to gain experience points. However, it became evident that these 56 hours are not the limit we need. With the patch, the maximum amount of stamina will be reduced from 56 hours to 42 hours.
      <br>
      To regenerate stamina, your character needs to be logged out. The regeneration starts after you have been logged off for 10 minutes. From then on, your character will gain 1 minute added to its stamina for every 3 minutes you are logged off. So it will take bit longer than before the patch to regenerate stamina.
      <br>
      And here comes the special part: Within the very first hour (hour 42), premium players will receive an experience bonus of 50%. So the amount of experience you get from killing a creature will raise considerably during this hour. On PvP-enforced worlds, this bonus will not apply to experience gained by killing another player.
      <br>
      Due to this bonus, it will be a bit easier for players who do not have much time to play to keep up with others. However, it will take even longer to regenerate the stamina for hour 42 since you gain way more experience in it. For every 12 minutes you are logged off you get 1 minute added to the character's stamina.
      <br>
      Please note that you will still get reduced experience points from killing creatures within the final 14 hours: defeated creatures will then yield only half the experience.
      <br>
      <br>
      To balance fights between monsters and players better, we will add a
      <b>
       delay
      </b>
      of 2 seconds to fighting and aggressive spells after teleporting. This means whenever you use a teleport, change floor levels, enter a room via a portal, travel with NPCs, use the Levitate spell or get kicked out of a house, for example, you cannot attack a creature nor use aggressive spells for 2 seconds.
      <br>
      Creatures now have enough time to attack you if you change the floor level and wait until you can attack them. This means,
      <i>
       stairhopping
      </i>
      without getting hit by creatures is no longer possible unless you only take a quick look but do not want to attack. Make sure you can handle the creatures that await you before you enter a spawn!
      <br>
      <br>
      Don't you think that an
      <b>
       invisible creature
      </b>
      should be invisible for all players? We do. Hence, we will add real invisibility for monsters, something that will mainly affect players who cheated to target these creatures. Here is our message for you: Our client will not contain any information on invisible monsters anymore. It will be impossible to aim missile runes on the coordinate of an invisible creature.
      <br>
      <br>
      Last but not least, here comes the icing on the cake: We will implement an
      <b>
       experience counter
      </b>
      that provides you with information on the experience you still need to advance to the next level. Furthermore, it calculates the experience you make per hour and tells you how long it would take you to reach the next level with this experience per hour ratio. The calculation will be based on the experience you gained within the last 15 minutes.
      <br>
      Where to find the experience counter? In the skill window, below your experience, we will implement an experience progress bar. It can be hidden like any other progress bar in the skill window. The new information will be shown as a tooltip if you move your mouse pointer over that bar. In the context menu of the skills window, you will find an option to reset the experience counter whenever you like.
      <br>
      <br>
      Finally, with this patch we invite you to another
      <b>
       week of double experience
      </b>
      . Just like the last time, double experience will be granted for experience gained from creatures only. It will start with the patch and run until the following Wednesday, March 25, server save time.
      <br>
      <br>
      Get ready for the spring patch!
