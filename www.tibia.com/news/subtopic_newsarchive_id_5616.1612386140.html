        Tibians,

      <p>
       at the end of March we introduced a number of stamina changes, which were originally meant to last for only one month. After extending the period twice, we have now decided to keep these changes until further notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       To quickly recap, these are the changes which were made:
      </p>
      <p>
       Premium accounts will receive a +50% XP boost during their first three hours of stamina instead of only the first two. The regeneration rate of green stamina (between 39 hours and 42 hours) has been lowered to 6 seconds per 1 second of stamina instead of previously 10 seconds per 1 second of stamina. After logging out, you will need to wait 18 hours and 10 minutes to regenerate the full three hours of green stamina. The increased green stamina regeneration also applies to the stamina regeneration in resting areas.
      </p>
