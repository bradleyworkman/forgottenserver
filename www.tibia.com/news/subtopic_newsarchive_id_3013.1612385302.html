      waiting is over. The winter update 2014 has just been released and is finally online.
      <br>
      <br>
      In case you missed one of the previous teasers or just cannot remember them properly, we have a short summary of what is waiting for you:
      <br>
      <br>
      A new menace is threatening the city of Rathleton and the magistrate of the town needs your help to bring down the dangerous inventor
      Jaccus Maxxen
      . Be warned though, Maxxen is just as deadly as he is smart. Therefore, this challenge will not be an easy one.
      <br>
      As a result of the difficulty of this quest, only citizens of Rathleton with the new rank of a squire will be allowed to try their luck to fight and to defeat this evil inventor.
      <br>
      In order to reach the new rank, a lot of
      new jobs
      are waiting for you on Oramond to prove that you are worthy.

      <br>
      Furthermore, a large and yet unknown underwater area waits for you beneath Oramond. Search for Mr Brandon and help him get his lost ring back. Do not forget your helmet of the deep when you dive down to explore this stunning but deadly dungeon. Beware of the
      seacrest serpents
      , they are not only impressive but also hungry and they love human flesh...
      <br>
      <br>
      You do not like getting wet and prefer the hot climate of the desert? Then you should head to Darashia and search for the
      Lion's Rock
      . If you manage to solve the old and mystical riddle in the hidden ancient temple, you might be rewarded with a noble and majestic companion who will accompany you on your future adventures.
      <br>
      <br>
      Also, the piratess One-Eyed Joe is looking for some assistance. Search for her on Nargor and follow her instructions and disclose the secret of the
      crystal gardens
      there.

      <br>
      Once again, several graphics have been adjusted and new, improved animations have been added to the Tibian world. Please note that this graphical improvement is still a long-term project so further improved animations might be added in future updates.
      <br>
      <br>
      Last but not least, a lot of
      new features
      have been implemented to make guilds more interesting and more attractive.
      <br>
      In order to further support the communal life in guilds, we plan to add depot boxes to every guildhall in Tibia within the next week.
      <br>
      <br>
      The update will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also
      download
      the new stand-alone client version 10.70 from our download section.
      <br>
      <br>
      See you in Tibia!
