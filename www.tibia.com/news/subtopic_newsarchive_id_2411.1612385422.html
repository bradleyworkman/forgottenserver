       nestled on the shore of the deep blue ocean, a city made out of trees, a city guarded and inhabited by the old, mystical race of the elves, my race.
       <br>
       <br>
       My wonderful and beloved home, it is a sight to behold and never forget. Wanderers are flabbergasted by the refreshing chill of its shadows, the smell of its flowers, the pristine atmosphere, the kindness and wisdom of its inhabitants. An oasis of tranquillity and serenity. An architectural masterpiece tucked away amidst trees.
       <br>
       In our hearts, we hold the strings, and nature is our bow. Together, we make soft sweet music, and in Ab'Dendriel we have orchestrated a symphony of harmony and beauty.
       <br>
       The city is our safe haven and we are proud of it. Proud, that it was not crushed by the wheels of time! Proud, that it is one of the eldest cities, ruled by one of the eldest races in Tibia! Proud, that this arcane place still has its own secrets and unsolved riddles...
       <br>

       <br>
       ...but alas, the world is changingÂ… the veil has been lifted. What was once only visible for our elvish eyes has been uncovered for everyone to see... even for the young and capricious human race that even missed the forest for the tree for centuries. Oh mighty Ashar'tel! Why, oh why? What happened? Why have you decided to reveal your existence to outsiders? Or were you forced against your will by an unknown power? Oh Ashar'tel! Where will it end? Will you betray all your secrets now?... Oh Ashar'tel... Oh Ashar'tel...
