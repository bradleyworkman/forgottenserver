      iquanda is the name of the new area which will be the setting for this year's summer update. From the mountains of Kha'zeel that separate Tiquanda from the Daramian desert rises the river Mahaji that meanders through the jungle until it reaches the west coast. The warm and humid climate here creates ideal conditions for many colourful plants, various mushrooms in all sizes, bushes and fruit trees. Old giant trees covered by lianas can be found in the deep rainforest in the centre of Tiquanda called the Baksha.
      <br>
      The only human settlement in Tiquanda is called Port Hope as it represents the hope to survive and to build up a new life in these harsh surroundings. The first humans that walked on Tiquanda came here by accident. Travelling to Thais, a few sailors from Venore were shipwrecked by a heavy storm and found shelter on the hitherto unknown coast of Tiquanda. Exotic plants awaited the castaways and the thick forest provided enough material to fix the ship. Soon they were ready to set the sails again. Upon their arrival in Thais, the exotic fruits, mushrooms and tropical wood were quickly recognised as profitable trade goods and a few brave Thaians and Venorans returned to colonise the unknown land.
      <br>
      Today Port Hope has established itself as a great starting point for the fearless adventurer to explore Tiquanda. Until now, only few humans have dared to set foot into the widely unexplored land of the Baksha, and even fewer have returned, spreading seemingly unbelievable stories about giant apes living in ancient ruins and intelligent, lizard-like creatures roaming the jungle. Any adventurer who is brave or foolish enough to explore a place where nature's reign is still undisputed and death lurks behind every tree will find his challenge here.
