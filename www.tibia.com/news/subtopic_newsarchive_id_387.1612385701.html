      Liberty Bay is the jewel of the South Seas. The prospering seaport is located on Vandura, the largest of the Shattered Isles. In no other Tibian city the poor and the rich live so close together and nowhere else is the difference between the classes so striking. In the southern part of the city, the people live in ramshackle huts and rest their weary heads on straw mats after a hard day's work on the plantations. In contrast, the stately homes of the aristocracy that resides in the North are splendid and luxurious. Provided you have a
      Premium Account
      and enough gold coins in your pockets to pay the horrendous rents there, you, too, will be able to enjoy the life in one of those grand mansions soon!

      See you in Tibia!
