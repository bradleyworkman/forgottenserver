      ith today's server save, a few content fixes and changes were implemented.
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li>
        We addressed an issue with NPC Chartan. It is now possible again to finish his tasks.
       </li>
       <li>
        NPC Ashari now reacts correctly to all keywords.
       </li>
       <li>
        Furthermore, we addressed an issue with the use of nebuliser in the Ancient Dreams quest. The nebuliser now works as intended.
       </li>
       <li>
        If you change the light settings in the stand-alone client, creature names and health bar are no longer affected.
       </li>
       <li>
        The use of hotkeys while walking in the Tibia Flash client does not affect the speed of your character anymore.
       </li>
       <li>
        We also addressed an issue with the Tibia Migration Tool in Google Chrome. It should now be possible to use it with this browser without any problems.
       </li>
       <li>
        Last but not least, some typos and map issues have been fixed as well.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Together with the content fixes and changes, a new client version will be available.
The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.35 from our
      download section
      .

      Have fun!
