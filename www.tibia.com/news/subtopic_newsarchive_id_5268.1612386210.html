       These are some of the bug fixes which have been introduced in the latest patch: The PZ fields on the steamboat in Kazordoon have been removed. Instead, the NPC Junkar now checks if a player has a PZ block and will not teleport players with a block. An expired blister ring no longer counts as supplies in the Hunt Analyser. Lastly, from now on the Low Blow charm's damage will be calculated in the following manner: 8% are added to your critical hit weapon chance against the creature you've used your charm on. If a critical hit is dealt due to these additional 8%, every charm creature affected by the attack will receive crit damage. The charm's description has been changed accordingly.
