       As of today's server save, you can obtain the splendorous
       golden outfit
       from Tibian royals. Moreover, the following changes were implemented: The three different types of rusty armour can now be distinguished by their look and name. Arena deaths will no longer fill up health and mana. If you die there, your character will respawn in the arena foyer with 40 hit points and the amount of mana it had upon death. Arena NPCs offer potions for a higher price. Also, two new loyalty titles have been added: Savant of Tibia (6000 Loyalty Points) and Enlightened of Tibia (7000 Loyalty Points).
