           For some time past, we have received many reports about a new and unknown species of lions. Of course, we tried to follow up every rumour and other traces but unfortunately, our efforts came to nothing. We could not find any proof about the existence of such a creature, no matter how hard we searched. However, last week one of our Daraman correspondents found a promising hint:
           <br>
           <br>
           North of Darashia, he discovered a rock formation. The nomades call it the
           <i>
            Lion's Rock
           </i>
           . They also warn strangers that only the worthy will be able to lift the secret of this place and to survive the threats which are waiting inside the rock.
           <i>
            "Nothing but death awaits you, if you try to break the peace of these majestic creatures without the right to enter their realm. Though, if you can convince them that you have a heart of a lion yourself, they might even bow to you."
           </i>
           , so said one of their tribal leaders. That just sounds like the right thing for all of us, doesn't it? A real challenge!

           Dear THE CHALLENGER,
           <br>
           <br>
           a few days ago, I travelled to Nargor in order to help the rebels on Meriana and to kill as many pirates as possible. I have done that quite often in the past already, but that day it was different. For the first time, I met a pirate there who talked to me instead of trying to slit my throat. Her name was
           <i>
            One-Eyed Joe
           </i>
           , not necessary to explain her name I guess, and if I may add, she looked very pretty for a pirate. Anyway, she told me a weird story about a place called crystal gardens and an old evil that has to be destroyed. I am not sure if she spoke the truth, but in my opinion it sounded like a good story for you. I hope you will send out a team and soon tell us more about these crystal gardens.
           <br>
           <br>
           Yours,
