       If you want to make a great entrance at a Tibian costume party, the
       <b>
        ceremonial garb
       </b>
       is certainly a good choice. With a drum over your shoulder and adorned with feathers you are perfectly dressed to lead a carnival parade through the streets of Thais.
       <br>
       <br>
       You can find the ceremonial garb in the
       <i>
        Outfits
       </i>
       section in the payment system. Once bought and assigned to one of your characters, you can wear the outfit ingame anytime, no matter if you are a free account or a premium account. This outfit is purely cosmetic and does not bestow any benefits.
