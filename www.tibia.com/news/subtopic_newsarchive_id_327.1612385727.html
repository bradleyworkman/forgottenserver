      n a game in which more than 100,000 players take part, there are always some rotten apples that play in an unfair manner and destroy the fun of others. For example, some players try to gain an unfair advantage by using unofficial software, while others abuse game weaknesses to make the life of their fellow Tibians miserable. To equalise the chances for all players, we are going to introduce new anti-cheat features in the next game update.
      <br>
      <br>
      Have you ever been killed by a lured giant spider? From now on, creatures will just disappear if they are lured too far from their spawn point for a certain distance. The lurer will receive neither experience points nor loot, and the creature will reappear normally at the next respawn. Also, creatures will disappear if they have been roped up more than two floors.
      <br>
      <br>
      Are you tired of being blocked by magic fields placed on parcels? From now on, you can walk over all stacked bigger objects, like parcels, crates and chairs. Additionally, you cannot conjure magic fields on impassable objects, like a chest or a table. Therefore, blocking by using parcels and fire fields will not be possible anymore.
      <br>
      <br>
      Have you ever been caught in a trap? Now, non-offensive runes will automatically effect the person who uses the rune if there are more than one character standing on this field. Additionally, all ships and the pyramids of Ankrahmun will become protection zones. Also, rope spots cannot be blocked anymore. So you can be sure you will be always able to rope to safety even if there are items lying on the rope spot.
      <br>
      <br>
      You have scraped all your money together to buy this beautiful piano and then some fool comes around and smashes it? Buy big furniture now in handy construction kits. You can carry them in your backpack and unwrap them safely in all rentable houses. Once they have been unpacked, you can move them around as usual.
      <br>
      <br>
      Tired of seeing paladins training with some pickup tool in sheer endless training sessions? All throwing weapons, such as spears, throwing knives and stars, have now a certain probability to break and disappear. So after a while the paladin will run short of ammunition.
      <br>
      <br>
      Ever wondered how it was possible to fish without a bait? To catch a fish you will now need worms that will disappear from your inventory whenever you have actually made a catch. That does not only give a more realistic impression of this action, but, above all, it will also help to make the life of macro fishers more difficult. Since every experienced fisherman knows that worms are needed to make a good catch, you will not advance in your fishing skill if you have no bait in your backpack.
      <br>
      <br>
      You have stumbled again over one of the many macro users? A certain amount of soul points will now be needed to make runes in addition to your mana. You obtain soul points by slaying creatures whose experience points equal at least your character's level. For example, a level 20 can easily obtain soul points by killing trolls or wasps, up to level 40 a rotworm will do, and a level 150 will still receive them for killing a cyclops. You also gain soul points by sleeping in a bed. Just like mana and hit points, promoted characters will also gather soul points more quickly. To avoid a shortage of runes due to a lack of macroing druid farms, you can buy them now at the NPC of your trust in your favourite magic shop. A character that is played actively and in a fair manner will hardly experience any difference at all. But finding a macro druid should become an exceptional occurrence from now on!
