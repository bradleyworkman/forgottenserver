      ith today's server save, we implemented a few content fixes and changes.
      <br>
      <br>
      The recent PVP fixes which were tested on the preview worlds last week, were added to all game worlds:
      <ul>
       <li>
        It is not possible any longer to use blocked summons in PVP to trap people in a stack. The summons can now be killed by the trapped players.
       </li>
       <li>
        Another issue where a player could get a skull while defending himself in Dove mode has been fixed as well.
       </li>
       <li>
        Also, we addressed some minor technical PVP issues.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
       In addition, we edited some of the NPCs concerning their new icons.
      </li>
      <li>
       The NPC channel now opens only if you are talking to an NPC.
      </li>
      <li>
       Furthermore, we adjusted the loot of demons and hellhounds.
      </li>
      <li>
       Last but not least, some map issues and typos have been fixed as well.
      </li>
      <br>
      Together with the content fixes and changes, a new client version will be available.
The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.37 from our
      download section
      .
      <br>
      <br>
      Enjoy!
