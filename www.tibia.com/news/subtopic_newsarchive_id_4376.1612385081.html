       ear Tibians,
      </p>
      <p>
       earlier this month, we
       announced
       that a new&nbsp;option called
       <em>
        Optimise Connection Stability
       </em>
       has been added to the client.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since
       <img align="left" height="250" hspace="8" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/warriornewsreader_wb.png', 'News Warrior', 'width=259, height=500')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/warriornewsreader_250.png" style="cursor: pointer;" vspace="2" width="130">
        then, we have been collecting and analysing data and want to proceed to the next step now: We have activated the new option on&nbsp;all game worlds
        <strong>
         &nbsp;
        </strong>
        to see if the system is working as intended.
       </img>
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, please&nbsp;
       <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
        activate
       </span>
       &nbsp;
       <em>
        Optimise Connection Stability
       </em>
       &nbsp;in your client's general options.
      </p>
      <p>
       This new
       <em>
        &nbsp;
       </em>
       system aims for an improved connection quality that should result in&nbsp;a smoother gaming experience&nbsp;in Tibia.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       We&nbsp;highly suggest to&nbsp;turn off third party&nbsp;software like tunnel&nbsp;or proxy services, since those programs can&nbsp;interfere with our new system and&nbsp;may conflict with&nbsp;our protection measures in case of a DDoS attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please keep in mind that the system cannot solve connection issues that are caused by your internet service provider or&nbsp;temporary&nbsp;congestions of local internet infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, if you are still experiencing unusual connection issues please make sure to follow the instructions of our
       technical FAQ
       . Providing us with&nbsp;such data helps us to identify the cause of your connection issues at a faster pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       See you in Tibia!
