        summer update brings some great new features for the Tibia client.
       </img>
      </p>
      <p>
       The client will be able to
       <strong>
        automatically take screenshots
       </strong>
       to capture important stages in the life of your Tibian character.
      </p>
      <p>
       In
       <img align="left" height="171" hspace="10" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/autoscreenshots.png', 'Auto Screenshot', 'width=687, height=491')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/autoscreenshots_small.png" style="cursor: pointer;" vspace="4" width="191">
       the advanced options menu you will find a new submenu, which allows you to&nbsp;activate different events&nbsp;for which a screenshot should be taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can choose whether you want to capture only the game window or the whole client interface. Assign a hotkey and you can trigger the screenshot feature whenever you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have activated the option "
       <em>
        Keep Backlog of the Screenshots of the Last 5 Seconds
       </em>
       ", additional screenshots of the last 5 seconds will be cached in the client and saved whenever the auto screenshot feature is triggered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another new feature is the
       <strong>
        Status Bar.
       </strong>
       The Status Bar offers you bigger health and mana bars and can be placed on the bottom, the top, or on the side of your game window. Right-click on the bar and you can choose from&nbsp;four different styles "
       <em>
        Compact
       </em>
       ", "
       <em>
        Default
       </em>
       ", "
       <em>
        Large
       </em>
       " and "
       <em>
        Parallel
       </em>
       ". Furthermore, you can select your skills and character level to be displayed as well. The Status Bar can be activated in the
       <em>
        HUD
       </em>
       submenu of your advanced options menu.

       Last but not least there are some changes for the
       <strong>
        Bestiary
       </strong>
       . For example, the newly added&nbsp;
       <em>
        Occurence
       </em>
       parameter will determine&nbsp;the rarity of a creature&nbsp;as "
       <em>
        Common
       </em>
       ", "
       <em>
        Uncommon
       </em>
       ", "
       <em>
        Rare
       </em>
       " or "
       <em>
        Very Rare
       </em>
       ". There is also a new level of difficulty called "
       <em>
        harmless
       </em>
       ". Creatures are classified as harmless if they neither deal damage nor give loot when they get killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       With
       <img align="right" height="119" hspace="10" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/midnight_panther_big.jpg', 'Bestiary Midnight Panther', 'width=668, height=390')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/midnight_panther_framed.png" style="cursor: pointer;" vspace="6" width="126">
       the exception of "Very Rare" classified harmless creatures, 25 kills are required to complete the respective Bestiary entry of a harmless creature. Each of these completed entries yields 1 Charm Point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides all harmless creatures, we also added many other creatures to the Bestiary that have been missing so far. If such creatures, regardless of their level of difficulty, are classified as "Very Rare", it will require 5 kills to complete their entry. Based on their difficulty, completed entries of "Very Rare" creatures provide 5 (Harmless), 10 (Trivial), 30 (Easy), 50 (Medium) or 100 (Hard) Charm Points.
