      ith today's server save, we implemented a few content fixes and changes, for example:
      <ul>
       <li>
        The walking animation of characters has been adjusted once again.
       </li>
       <li>
        We addressed an issue with the voting system in Rathleton. The dungeons should now work as intended again.
       </li>
       <li>
        We fixed the problem with Rafzan's elevator and also added a ladder to offer another option to reach him.
       </li>
       <li>
        The sandstone scorpion can be tamed again. Please note that the taming item still has a chance to break.
       </li>
       <li>
        Also, some other graphic as well as map bugs and typos have been fixed.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Please note that a new client version is available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.60 from our
      download section
      .
