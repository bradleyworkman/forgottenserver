      ith today's server save, we implemented a few content fixes and changes, for example:
      <ul>
       <li>
        We addressed an issue with the world change
        <i>
         The Mummy's Curse.
        </i>
        Game worlds that were stuck should be able to do this quest again.
       </li>
       <li>
        An issue with one of the half-buried faces on Roshamuul has been fixed as well.
       </li>
       <li>
        Dawnport spells are now listed correctly in the dialogues of the spell trainer NPCs on mainland.
       </li>
       <li>
        Furthermore, an issue with Pythius the Rotten has been fixed as well. The missing stone was added to Pythius' dungeon again and works as intended.
       </li>
       <li>
        From now on, justified kills result in a PZ lock of 15 minutes for both last hitter and most damage dealer on Retro Open PvP game worlds.
       </li>
       <li>
        Sticky threads for guild leaders and vice leaders now work as intended on guild boards.
       </li>
       <li>
        The entrance doors of the Warrior's guildhall have been moved back to their former position.
       </li>
       <li>
        Also, some other graphic and map bugs as well as typos have been fixed.
       </li>
       <li>
        Depot boxes have been added to all guildhalls.
       </li>
       <li>
        Last but not least, a new doll can be traded at Ruprecht.
       </li>
      </ul>
