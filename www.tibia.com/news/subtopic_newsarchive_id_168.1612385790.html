      oday we have released the client version 7.02 to fix several bugs.
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>
       Ignoring other player should now work again. You can also ignore yells and private messages.
      </li>
      <li>
       The annoying bug "GUI 1085" has been fixed. People who could not log into the game because of this bug, should be able to play again now.
      </li>
      <li>
       You cannot drag objects out of minimised containers anymore.
      </li>
      <br>
      You do not have to download a new client version. Instead your client will be updated automatically when you login next time. However, if the update process does not work correctly for you, you can download the complete version 7.02 from the download section. If you are using the "old client", no update is necessary.
      <br>

      See you in Tibia!
