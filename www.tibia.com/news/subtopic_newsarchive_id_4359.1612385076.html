       With today's server save, a new option has been added to the Options menu. The
       <em>
        Optimise Connection Stability
       </em>
       option is part of an extensive technical adjustment featuring a new automatic system to optimise connection quality. Please note: This option is
       <strong>
        non-functional
       </strong>
       for you
       <strong>
        at the moment
       </strong>
       and the new system is
       <strong>
        not yet active
       </strong>
       . Today's step just prepares a thorough testing phase during which we are going to gather and analyse data to ensure that the system is working as intended. We will provide further information on this matter in due time.
