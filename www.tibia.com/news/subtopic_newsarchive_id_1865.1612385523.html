      oday, a small patch has been released. As we announced yesterday, we have implemented the new
      tutor system
      .
You can now receive "Thank you!'s" from other players for helpful posts and statements. If you reach a certain amount of "Thank you!'s" within a specific timeframe and fulfill some minor requirements, you will automatically become a tutor. Want to know more? Check the
      tutor guide
      for further information on the new system.
      <br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the Beta Flash client has been updated to Flash Player plugin version 11.0. In addition, we also fixed a couple of minor bugs and issues in the Beta Flash client. Just to name two examples: the size of the container widget does not change unexpectedly anymore when dragging the widget or opening another container. Also, the "Click to activate" message has been moved to the top half of the window so that it does not hide the content of client messages anymore.
      <br>
      <br>
      The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also
      download
      the new stand-alone client version 9.31 from our download section.

      Have fun!
