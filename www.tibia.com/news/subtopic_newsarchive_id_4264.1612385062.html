       ellow Tibians,
       <br>
       we have used the extended downtime to implement new features to our website.
       <br>
       From now on, you are able to&nbsp;see if a game world is protected by BattlEye. Therefore, we have added two new icons, which are displayed next to the corresponding game world name in your account management:
      </p>
      <table>
       <tbody>
        <tr>
         <td>
          <img height="18" hspace="10" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/be_icon_green.gif" vspace="10" width="18">
         </td>
         <td>
          The game world is&nbsp;initially protected by BattlEye
         </td>
         <td>
          <img height="18" hspace="10" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/be_icon_yellow.gif" vspace="10" width="18">
         </td>
         <td>
          The game world protected&nbsp;by BattlEye&nbsp;since a certain date.
         </td>
        </tr>
       </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
       Those icons are also displayed in the game world overview and in the character creation interface. We have also added a "BattlEye Status" section in the world information, which will tell you since when the game world is protected by BattlEye.
       <br>
       Last but not least, it is now possible to filter by BattlEye protected game worlds in the character creation.
      </p>
      <center>
       <img height="22" hspace="10" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/be_filter.png" vspace="2" width="525">
      </center>
      <p>
       Additionally, we have added a new FAQ to our support interface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, we have released a few bugfixes for the Tibia 11 client. Among others, we changed the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Activating your numpad while walking now interrupts your character's movement.
       </li>
       <li>
        It is now possible to set a hotkey for
        <strong>
         "Combat: Toggle Chase Mode"
        </strong>
        .
       </li>
       <li>
        An issue causing the slider to reset while selling items to an NPC has been fixed.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Have a nice day in Tibia!
