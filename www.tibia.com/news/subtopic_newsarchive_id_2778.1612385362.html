       you up for a game of Tibian football but you lack proper clothing? Your character's fancy outfits are not comfortable enough to perform a bicycle kick? You are a fan and want to wear the colours of your favourite team?
       <br>
       <br>
       Then we might have just the thing for you! Why not sport the easy fitting and comfortable jersey outfit in your next Tibian football match?! If you want to take a closer look at it, just click on the football to the right.
       <br>
       <br>
       From server save on Thursday, June 12, on, all accounts with premium status can select the jersey outfit for their characters via the outfit menu ingame. It can be worn during the following four weeks which are hopefully packed with exciting football games and lots of fun!
       <br>
       <br>
       Get ready for kickoff!
