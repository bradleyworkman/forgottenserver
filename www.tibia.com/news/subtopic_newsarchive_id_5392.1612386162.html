       ear Tibians,
      </p>
      <p>
       today we released new balancing changes to address recent developments and feedback we have received. You can find all changes in the updated
       Hunting Ground Changes
       announcement and the
       Hunting Ground Focus
       announcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have not checked it out yet, you might want to have a look at our
       balancing FAQ
       as well, in which we address common concerns and explain things in detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have also fixed an issue with the macOS client which now allows players to experience the game in fullscreen mode again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Safe travels,
       <br>
