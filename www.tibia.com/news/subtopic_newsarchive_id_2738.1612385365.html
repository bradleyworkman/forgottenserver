      ith today's server save, we implemented a few content fixes and changes. For example:
      <br>
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li>
        There were some broken beds in the Tibian world. They have been fixed and should provide their usual comfort again.
       </li>
       <li>
        If you should ever lose a spyreport that you needed to complete a quest, you can now get a substitute copy if you talk to Black Bert.
       </li>
       <li>
        Omrafir should not leave a fight for good anymore.
       </li>
       <li>
        Further minor bugs, as well as map bugs and typos, have been fixed as well.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Together with these changes, a new client version will be available.
The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.39 from our
      download section
      .

      See you in Tibia!
