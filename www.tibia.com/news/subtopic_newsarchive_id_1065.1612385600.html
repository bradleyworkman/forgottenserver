       n the past weeks, we released developer notes about two important features we are planning to implement in Tibia: a
       war system
       and a
       character world transfer
       service. We already mentioned that both concepts will come along with a general realignment of the game world types. Thus, the conditions on the existing world types will change. With new conditions, however, the existing names are not appropriate anymore so the names for the game world types will change as well.
       <br>
       <br>
       In this featured article, we would like to present you our plans for realigning the game world types. Even though a few details are still under internal discussion, the overall concept is set. So here we go:

      <p>
       <br>
       <u>
        Goal Setting
       </u>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Characters should be fully protected from attacks and disturbances of other characters. PvP is based on mutual agreement so only possible if both sides agree.
       </li>
       <li>
        PvP fights should only affect the involved characters. In return, uninvolved characters should not be allowed to interfere in PvP fights.
       </li>
       <li>
        It is of utmost importance to prevent players from influencing others in a negative way or even forcing them to do something they do not want to do. Ways and means to oppress others should be eliminated via game design as effectively as possible.
       </li>
       <li>
        We recommend this game world type to all players who wish to play safely and only want to engage in fights which they have agreed to.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <u>
        Features
       </u>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Characters can neither be attacked, damaged or killed by other characters nor can they be influenced in a negative way (e.g. by Paralyse). The only exception is within the scope of the war system. However, the war system cannot be used on Rookgaard.
       </li>
       <li>
        No skull system.
       </li>
       <li>
        Blocking with characters and summons is not possible anymore.
       </li>
       <li>
        A war system: As long as characters are not in a protection zone, they are attackable, vulnerable and can block each other. Duels, arenas, guild alliances including alliance wars will be implemented at a later date.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="padding: 5px; border: medium double #000000;">

       <u>
        Goal Setting
       </u>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Tibia has always been a tough game and the possibility to attack and kill any other character anytime pretty much anywhere should be possible with certain restrictions.
       </li>
       <li>
        Basically, the oppression of others is possible and allowed. However, killing other characters is controlled and regulated by the skull system.
       </li>
       <li>
        Characters should be protected from attacks or any other negative influences of characters in their own party or guild.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <u>
        Features
       </u>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Characters can be attacked, damaged, killed or influenced in a negative way (e.g. via Paralyse) by other characters as long as they are not in a protection zone or on Rookgaard.
       </li>
       <li>
        Skull system is active.
       </li>
       <li>
        Blocking with characters and summons is possible.
       </li>
       <li>
        A war system: Player kills within the war system count as justified kills. Duels, arenas, guild alliances including alliance wars will be implemented at a later date.
       </li>
       <li>
        At a later date, we plan to abolish friendly fire. Then, attacking and damaging party or guild members will not be possible anymore unless a party member is a war opponent. This means, training with allies will only be possible in duels then. Further details about friendly fire and duels will be discussed in due time.
       </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
       <li>
        Characters should be able to attack, kill or influence others in a negative way without any restrictions.
       </li>
       <li>
        The oppression of others is possible and allowed. Even more, it is also allowed within your own party or guild without any restrictions.
       </li>
       <li>
        Guild wars, duels and arenas should help players with organising fights but do not have another functional meaning like on the other game world types.

         Further remarks
        </strong>
       </u>
       <br>
       <br>
       The realignment of the game world types will come along with the character world transfer service and is based on the goals we outlined in the
       featured article
       of May which dealt with PvP system in Tibia.
       <br>
       Moreover, it is also designed to narrow the gap between the world types and to reduce the differences to a few important core features. This will make it easier for players to choose on which world to play. They will only have to decide between the three sets of core features whereas features such as the war system or blessings will be available on each game world type.
       <br>
       <br>
       We will also improve the description of the world types in the documentation. In addition, an explanation of the world types will be displayed when a player creates a new character or initiates a world transfer.
       <br>
       Players will be made aware of what to expect on a certain type of game world type. So while open and hardcore PvP worlds offer you more PvP freedom, other players with characters on these worlds can also make use of this freedom when fighting against you.
       <br>
       <br>
       This year's autumn patch will be all about the world type realignment, including the war system and the character world transfer. Even though there is no fixed date yet it will only be a matter of a few weeks until its release.
