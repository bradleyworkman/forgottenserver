        winter update has been released! Time to follow-up on the most important features and changes that await you in Tibia from now on.
       </img>
      </p>
      <p>
       Gnomes and dwarfs are striving against&nbsp;
       those below
       ! Yet,&nbsp;the malicious servants&nbsp;are growing stronger and stronger.&nbsp;Prove yourself worthy and join the battle to enter a total of three new warzones. In there, the&nbsp;true power of twisted monsters rotten to the core and devious bosses awaits you!
      </p>
      <p>
       Another great danger is threatening the inhabitants of Edron and Cormaya!&nbsp;Learn more about the contagious
       were-sickness
       and prevent it from spreading further into Tibia! Look out for hints and find the cure, but be careful, those bloodthirsty were-creatures come with&nbsp;razor sharp claws and fangs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not forget to look for poor Coryms that have been enslaved and sent into the deepest mines to dig for rare minerals. Their eternal&nbsp;gratefulness will be your reward if you are able to free them from their oppressors!

      <p>
       All players&nbsp;are now able to use the new
       Quick Looting
       &nbsp;option Loot All, which allows you to loot all items from a monster's body with a single click. Premium players can additionally use the Loot Click function. Furthermore, they can activate a definable loot container structure to sort their loot automatically and&nbsp;use lists to make the&nbsp;Loot All function&nbsp;more granular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another cool feature is the container position saving, which enables the client to&nbsp;reopen&nbsp;all your widgets and backpacks at the same position whenever you log in again.
      </p>
      <p>
       A new imbuement has been added as well. From now on, you can imbue your equipped backpack with a
       featherweight imbuement
       and thereby raise your character's capacity by a certain percentage.&nbsp;
       <br>
       Speaking of imbuements, umbral and master umbral weapons can now be enhanced with imbuements too!
       <br>
       Besides that, all weapons "of Mayhem/Remedy/Carving" have been transformed to new "of Destruction" weapons and points for kill tasks can now be gained through kill assists if you are in a party with the killer and if shared XP is active.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new&nbsp;
       Bestiary
       contains a lot of information about all kind of different creatures in Tibia. The more creatures you kill, the more details will be revealed. Gain Charm Points by completing a creature's entry and use them to unlock rare charms.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find additional changes and features in our news about the
       most important changes
       during the test server.
      </p>
      <p>
       We hope you all enjoy the winter update and have a wonderful time in Tibia!
