      This year Santa has made a present for his little elfish helpers. Since nature left its marks on the wooden walls of the evergreen elven city Ab'dendriel, Santa decided that it is high time to restore all buildings there. The decayed walls have been replaced by new solid tree walls which can be embellished by
      Premium
      players with family pictures, colourful tapestries, fancy cuckoo clocks or shiny mirrors. The awesome new tree houses impress particularly with their knothole windows and their terrific roofs decorated with gnarled roots, grass mats and exotic plants. Also the old planks of the bridges have been refurbished. Finally, when it gets dark and you look very closely, you might spot one of the little fireflies that Santa has left in this area to brighten the gloomy sky at night-time.
