       oday, we released another update for the Tibia 11 client. Among others, we were able to fix the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The character now moves to an item laying on the ground while walking via minimap click if you try to open or use it.
       </li>
       <li>
        An issue, which under certain circumstances caused the NPC trade window to display buy offers in the sell category, is now fixed.
       </li>
       <li>
        We added a checkbox "Show Combat Frames" to the status options.
       </li>
       <li>
        An issue allowing the character to attack creatures by using the "Attack next/previous target" hotkey even if a battle list filter hid them is now fixed.
       </li>
       <li>
        We reduced the delay a character experienced after changing directions.
       </li>
       <li>
        We fixed a visual bug causing the character to look in one direction while casting spells in another direction.
       </li>
       <li>
        An issue blocking the character's movement after it logged out and in again on a certain level in Kazordoon is now fixed.
       </li>
       <li>
        The character does no longer stop its movement after changing directions while&nbsp;using a hotkey at the same time.
       </li>
       <li>
        An issue causing the client to crash is now fixed.
       </li>
      </ul>
