       ith today's server save, we have implemented a few fixes and changes, for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The handling of the quiver has been improved: You can now put a new stack of ammunition&nbsp;into your quiver via hotkey or action button equip if there is enough space. Moreover,&nbsp;a number on top of your&nbsp;equipped quiver now tells you how much ammunition is still inside.
       </li>
       <li>
        After the release of the vocation adjustments, we received additional feedback about the damage spread for single target, non-critical physical range and melee attacks. We have now made the following change to narrow the spread for a more consistent and stable damage: The minimum damage of single target, non-critical physical range and melee attacks has been increased to avoid very low hits. While their maximum damage has not been changed&nbsp;so that occasional high damage spikes are still possible, we have&nbsp;lowered its probabilities to ensure that the average damage output remains the same.
       </li>
       <li>
        The colour of Divine Dazzle's effect has been changed to distinguish it from Chivalrous Challenge. Additionally, Expose Weakness has received a different visual effect to set it apart from Sap Strength.
       </li>
       <li>
        When using the Arc HUD for a druid or sorcerer, the magic shield arc will now only be displayed if your magic shield is active.
       </li>
       <li>
        We implemented a fix to address the reported problem of occasionally getting stuck for a short time while quick looting.
       </li>
       <li>
        Familiars that have been temporarily transformed into a creature now change back to the skin you selected for your familiar.
       </li>
       <li>
        We fixed a few minor NPC and map issues.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Also, the following game worlds have been opened for free accounts: Adra, Emera, Javibra, Libertabra, Ragna, Unica, Utobra, Wizera, Xylona, Ysolera and Zenobra.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, we have removed the transfer block from Belluma, Dibra and Torpera. Please keep in mind that you can only move to a game world initially protected by BattlEye if your character also comes from a game world which has been protected right from its release.
      </p>

       Have fun in Tibia!
