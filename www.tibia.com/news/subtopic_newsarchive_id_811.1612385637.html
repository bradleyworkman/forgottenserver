      ime has come for another small patch which has been launched today.
      <br>
      <br>
      What has been changed?
      <br>
      <list>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Some earth elementals in the Tiquanda jungle have fought each other about territorial rights. As many died in those battles, their numbers have gone down.
        </li>
        <li>
         Jessica and Odemara have proudly announced that they have both added goblets to their sales list.
        </li>
        <li>
         A few NPCs got another class in orthography and grammar. They will be happy to prove it!
        </li>
        <li>
         Fun spellwands have been altered so that they cannot be used on invisible characters anymore.
        </li>
        <li>
         Last, but not least: a few minor technical corrections on our client have been made along with several small bug fixes concerning map or graphic bugs, e.g. the blue pixels in rubies.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </list>
      Thanks to everyone who helped with reporting game errors!
