       If you would like to save a bit of time while playing, these products may come in handy. They are consumables which means they have a one-time effect and then need to be purchased again.
       <br>
       If you want to get further information on a product before buying, select it in the Store and then click on "Details" to learn more about this specific product.
       <br>
       <br>
       In order to further optimise Dawnport and the tutorial, we have also implemented a few small adjustments such as additional hints and tool tips with today's server save.
       <br>
       <br>
       Please note that a new client version is available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.82 from our
       download section
       .

       Have fun!
