        the old character outfits? It has been more than ten years already, since they were re-designed!
        <br>
        Well, you cannot celebrate a retro month if you have no&nbsp;suitable clothes to wear! Therefore, it is time for their long awaited revival. A first batch of four retro outfits has been added to the Store today!

       Prepare your character to walk the streets&nbsp;of&nbsp;the upcoming two new Retro Open PvP game worlds as a
       <strong>
        Retro Citizen!&nbsp;
        <br>
       </strong>
       Sharpen your sword and polish your shield before you throw yourself fearlessly into battle to protect your party members as a
       <strong>
        Retro Knight.
       </strong>
       <br>
       If you are more interested in distance fighting with arrows and spears, the
       <strong>
        Retro Hunter
       </strong>
       should be your matching outfit.
       <br>
       Last but not least you can dress up as a&nbsp;
       <strong>
        Retro Mage
       </strong>
       and you will always cut a fine figure on the battleground while eliminating your enemies with your magical powers!
      </p>
      <p>
       Once bought, your character can wear these&nbsp;outfits anytime. The outfits are&nbsp;purely cosmetic and do not bestow any benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay tuned for more to come!
