       <br>
       How could I overlook that massive, huge tower? I combed the jungle a thousand times and have never noticed that building. It looks very ancient but also threatening.
       <br>

       To enter the tower I had to pass a subterranean passage where a lot of stony creatures tried to stop me.
       <br>
       The tower itself is like a giant circular staircase with many floors. On every level, death is waiting for you if you are not focused enough. The higher I climbed, the harder I had to fight for my life.
       <br>
       At least, I made a big haul. Although, I am not sure if I have the chance to sell my loot...
