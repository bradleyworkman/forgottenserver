      uring the last months, we were working on the development of a new tutor system to foster the gratifying experience of helping others and encourage players to lend a helping hand and share their knowledge.

      In order to implement the new system, the server save of all game worlds will take approximately one hour longer tomorrow, October 20, and the website will be temporarily offline during that time as well.
      <br>
      The main feature of the new system is the possibility to receive a "Thank you!" from other players for helpful posts and statements. If you fulfill some minor requirements and reach a certain amount of "Thank you!'s" within a specific timeframe, you will automatically become a tutor.
      <br>
      <br>
      Appointed tutors can still receive "Thank you!'s", of course. The more "Thank you!'s" a tutor has received, the more stars will be displayed below the tutor's name in forum posts if you choose to show your tutor status.
      <br>
      <br>
      Where to get "Thank you!'s"? As soon as the patch has been released, you can find the details about the new system and the role of tutors in the tutor guide. So make sure to check the updated version after tomorrow's downtime.
      <br>
      <br>
      All current tutors will be incorporated into the new tutor system. There will be no senior tutor rank anymore but the old senior tutors will receive 2 stars for their previous work instead of one which tutors receive.
      <br>
      <br>
      Lend a helping hand!
