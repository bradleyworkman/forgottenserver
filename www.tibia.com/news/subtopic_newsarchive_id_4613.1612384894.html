           Those frequently upcoming desert storms in Darama might be caused by guzzlemaws having a cold. Due to nasal congestions, they sneeze out an enormous amount of air through their jaws and send them westwards across the sea towards the desert.

          <p align="left">
           Just a few days ago, a sandstorm uncovered a very interesting statue not far from here. It seems to mark the entrance to an ancient site. I have already sent down some of my men to further investigate the area but they returned empty handed.

           They said powerful and complicated mechanisms are protecting the place from unwanted intruders and they were not able to solve them. I will have to request additional resources from the headquarter. This place requires a lot more brainpower than we have right now.

           MOTA&nbsp;MANAGER MESSAGE
          </strong>
          <br>
          <p align="left">
           I consider my Museum of Tibian Arts to be one of the most important buildings known to Tibian kind. Thanks to the numerous donations of our loyal patrons, we are now able to to&nbsp;start the long&nbsp;overdue extension of the MoTA. The museum will become even larger and offer more diversity and art.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           As a matter of fact, we have already torn down the first walls but are currently facing some difficulties that might prolong the whole expansion. Behind those walls, we discovered a strange portal that seems to work as a passage for sinister creatures into&nbsp;my beloved museum.

           Our efforts to close that portal&nbsp;have failed miserably. It&nbsp;just&nbsp;reappears! Aside from that, we are&nbsp;considered civilised experts in archaeology, the very idea of&nbsp;fighting monsters is abhorrent to us. Especially since those&nbsp;monstrosities surpass our known museum monsters in terms of strength and brutality by far.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
           Therefore, we are looking for a very smart, yet physically strong Tibian, who is able to traverse the portal and take care of whatever is hiding behind it.
