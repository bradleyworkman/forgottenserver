       My old friend. I hope you are doing well and I am very sorry to disturb you but I have to share something with you. You are not going to believe this. Well, let me start from the beginning.
       <br>
       <br>
       Some days ago, I decided to travel to Carlin to visit the city library since I have never been there before. So I took the ship from Edron to Ab'Dendriel. From there I continued by foot because I wanted to admire the beautiful nature and wildlife. After a while, I could see Carlin from afar. All that was left to pass were some tree houses that reminded me of the elvish town I had just left.
       <br>
       <br>
       As a druid and a member of the explorer society, I have seen a lot of things in my life, and many of them were missing a good and logical explanation, but what I have seen here was just incredible...
       <br>
       When I was walking between those tree houses, straight towards Carlin, I got attacked by a pile of leaves all of a sudden. Yes, LEAVES!

        Creatures as tall as a cyclopes, giants made of countless leaves and twigs.
I had not seen them coming as they were blending in perfectly with trees and bushes. What a deadly surprise. I climbed up to one of the tree houses but not to save my life as I first had thought. When I was standing there on a wooden platform, trying to recover my breath and watching the deadly leaf creatures from above I heard a strange noise. It sounded like horse hooves on a wooden floor. I turned around and in the twinkling of an eye I was confronted with
        <br>
        <br>
        <img align="right" height="305" hspace="10" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/forestfury.jpg', 'forestfury', 'width=568, height=692')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/forestfury_small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer;" vspace="10" width="250">
         Half horse, half woman. Her green eyes were full of bloodlust and one look into her face convinced me that it would be a waste of time to ask for mercy. On the head, they grew a pair of antlers that would even make a kingly deer go green with envy. Instead of hands, she had two big paws with long and sharp claws. Not a moment too soon I used my magic shield, and started to run. Without the magic shield I would have been killed by the powerful paw swipe that hit my back. Alas, my luck was short lived. While I tried to escape the fury on my tail, another leaf creature attacked me head-on. It looked even more aggressive and stronger than the ones which attacked me down on the surface. I could not escape, they were everywhere. I knew that I was close to death and that I had only one chance left: the possibility that those creatures are not able to sense invisibility. So I put on a stealth ring and well
I defied death once again. Obviously, they couldn't see me anymore and I made a quick getaway.
         <br>
         <br>
         What an adventure, don't you agree? Now, while I am writing this letter to you I wonder if there is any connection between this mutation of nature and those creatures near Ulderek's Rock you mentioned recently. You called them rorcs, didn't you?
         <br>
         <br>
         Yours sincerely!
         <br>
