        retro month is slowly coming to an end. Congratulations again to the winners of the contest "How Thais received its name"! The Retro Open PvP game worlds are up and running and Retro Citizens, Knights, Hunters and Mages are hunting&nbsp;through the lands of Tibia. To top&nbsp;off the retro month, we have added a second batch of retro outfits to the Store today.

       While the&nbsp;Retro Mage usually throws runes and mighty spells directly at the enemies, the
       <strong>
        Retro Summoner
       </strong>
       outfit might be the better choice for Tibians that prefer&nbsp;to send mighty summons to the battlefield&nbsp;to keep their enemies at distance.
       <br>
       King Tibianus has invited you to a summer ball and you have nothing to wear for this special event? Do not worry, the
       <strong>
        Retro
       </strong>
       &nbsp;
       <strong>
        Noble(wo)man
       </strong>
       outfit&nbsp;makes you a real&nbsp;eye catcher on every festive occasion.
       <br>
       You are fearless and strong as a behemoth but have problems finding the right outfit for your adventures? The
       <strong>
        Retro Warrior
       </strong>
       outfit is a must-have for all&nbsp;fashion-conscious Tibians out there.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Once bought, your character can wear these&nbsp;outfits anytime.
       <br>
       The outfits are&nbsp;purely cosmetic and do not bestow any benefits.
