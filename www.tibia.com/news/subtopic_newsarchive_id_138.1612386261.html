      his time we present
      areas
      in Tibia for premium and free players. On the desert continent of Darama, premium players can explore oases, pyramids and haunted ruins. What is more, some old areas like Kazordoon and the Plains of Havoc have been revised, especially the enlarged mines of the dwarfs. There are also new and slightly redesigned
      creatures
      . Moreover, there are rumours about new great treasures that await the brave adventurer.
      <br>
      The complete map has been reset but all items in your houses and guildhalls have been saved.
      <br>
      <br>
      Have fun in Tibia!
