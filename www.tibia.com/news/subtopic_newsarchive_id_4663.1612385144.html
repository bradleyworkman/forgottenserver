       However, they are still viewed by the public with much suspicion due to their dubious appearance.

       To keep their identity secret, they often hide their faces behind a heavily armoured skull that can easily withstand even axe and club blows.

       Once bought, your character can wear this outfit anytime. The outfit is purely cosmetic and does not bestow any benefits.
