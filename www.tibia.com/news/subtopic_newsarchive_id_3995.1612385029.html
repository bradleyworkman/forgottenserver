       ellow Tibians, with today's server save we have implemented
       BattlEye
       into our stand-alone clients and therefore started the initial phase in which we will focus on gathering and analysing data.
       <br>
       <br>
       This&nbsp;being the case, it is likely that you do not yet experience significant changes of the botting situation ingame since&nbsp;BattlEye does not yet actively shield Tibia from cheating. Nevertheless, a few cheats, unauthorised tools and applications may already be blocked and stop working as a side-effect of the technical integration of BattlEye.
       <br>
       <br>
       Once BattlEye meets our quality standards and works as intended, it will be activated and shield Tibia against cheating. We will inform you about this activation as soon as we can provide you with a reliable date.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       The technical integration requires a new version of our clients. Tibia 11 users can download the update via the launcher. If you want to get the new&nbsp;version of the Tibia 10&nbsp;client, please visit our
       download section
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore,&nbsp;a new NPC called&nbsp;Edgar-Ellen arrived in Thais. He stands&nbsp;near the fountain on Royal Lane and recites the winning poems of our "
       <em>
        It's time to Rhyme
       </em>
       " contest.
