      elcome to the jungle! As many of you might already know by now, the summer update will mainly be a map update. The jungle will cover a huge new premium area located to
      the west of Ankrahmun
      . There will be plenty of new graphics, including many new plants, new buildings and of course also new monsters. In the jungle you can admire a variety of many colourful flowers, high trees and other exotic plants that will give the world of Tibia a whole new look. Take your sweetheart to a romantic trip to the waterfall but beware of the wild animals that roam the jungle. Of course there will also be a new settlement in the jungle which will provide you with all the facilities that you can find in a regular Tibia city. Players that like to settle down in this green paradise, can rent one of the nice pile dwellings. So if you would like to try out how cosy a hammock can be, start saving up today.

      We have distributed a few artworks and screenshots of the new area to the
      supported fansites
      . To get a first impression on how the new area will look like do not miss to take a look there.

      <br>
      See you in Tibia!
