      ith today's server save, a few content fixes and changes were implemented.
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li>
        If a player lost Eleonore's ring in the Shattered Isles quest he can finish this part of the quest after he used a rake on the parrot tree by saying "ring" to Eleonore.
       </li>
       <li>
        It is not possible anymore to block a diggable hole by putting items on it or by standing on it. You can now open the hole regardless of any item laying or any player standing on it and climb down the hole by walking upon it.
       </li>
       <li>
        You can now use the smart-click feature of the Tibia Flash client to open letters instantly.
       </li>
       <li>
        We fixed a small issue with NPC Ahmet that could make you stuck in the Thieves Guild quest under rare conditions.
       </li>
       <li>
        TibiaHof.com's fansite item jade amulet now weighs 4.00 oz.
       </li>
       <li>
        It is now possible to desecrate the shrines for the Necessary Desecration mission in Lower Roshamuul every 10 minutes instead of every 30 minutes.
       </li>
       <li>
        A small graphical bug with the female elementalist outfit has been fixed as well.
       </li>
       <li>
        Furthermore, we addressed an issue that let characters run in a certain direction without pressing the corresponding key in both clients.
       </li>
       <li>
        Last but not least, some minor typos and map issues have been fixed as well.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Together with the content fixes and changes, a new client version will be available.
The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.34 from our
      download section
