      oday, the server save will take longer than usual due to maintenance work. We are going to implement a new technical measure to increase the protection of our servers against DoS and DDoS attacks. The downtime will take about three hours so we expect all game worlds to be back online around 13:00 CEST approximately.
      <br>
      Of course, we will monitor the effects of this new technical measure, and make further adjustments if necessary.
      <br>
      <br>
      Once the game worlds are back online, a new client version will download automatically when you log in. Should you encounter any problems with this patching process, you can then also
      download
      the new stand-alone client version 10.11 from the account section.
      <br>
      <br>
      Thank you for your incredible support and patience during this difficult time. We truly appreciate it. Malicious activities such as DDoS attacks against our servers are meant to ruin the game experience of other Tibia players. We take this very seriously and we are doing everything we can to initiate proper short- and long-term measures to combat such attacks.
      <br>
      <br>
      Stay tuned!
