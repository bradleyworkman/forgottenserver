      e have a winner! Recently, we ran a
      contest
      in which we asked Tibians to suggest a name for the new rat-man race that will be introduced with the upcoming winter update.
      <br>
      <br>
      Once again, the excitement and enthusiasm shown by everyone who took part was outstanding. More than 4,000 names were proposed which kept us busy and entertained for several days. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all players for their contributions! Now let's get on to the winners!
      <br>
      <br>
      <img align="left" height="195" hspace="2" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/rat04_big.jpg', 'rat04', 'width=794, height=850')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/rat04_small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer;" width="187">
       Which name did the content team choose in the end? The name of the new race is:
       <br>
       <br>
       <center>
        Corym
        , suggested by Bunny Luv.
       </center>
       <br>
       <br>
       Congratulations! The decision was not easy as we had quite a long list of fancy names. Bunny Luv will be rewarded with premium time and a CM token later today, and also receive a new doll once the winter update has been released.
       <br>
       <br>
       The CMs also picked their top entries out of all submissions. Tjured's favourite name was
       Skron
       , submitted by Aridius. Rejana liked Verney's entry
       Caven
       best, and Mirade chose Demigan flamestrike's proposal
       Bast
       as her favourite.
       <br>
       Each of the three authors will also be rewarded with premium time and a CM token in the course of the day.
       <br>
       <br>
       We hope you enjoyed this contest as much as we did! Once again, thanks to all participants, and congratulations to the winners!
       <br>
       <br>
       See you in Tibia!
