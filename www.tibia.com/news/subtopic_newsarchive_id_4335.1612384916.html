        year's winter update&nbsp;includes some brand new features for the Tibia 11 client.&nbsp;
       </img>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us start with the
       <strong>
        Quick Looting
       </strong>
       feature.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       The quick looting feature allows you to set up a customisable inventory structure, which is going to help you to automatically sort your loot during your hunting sessions.
       <br>
       Furthermore, the quick looting feature modernises the existing looting process and allows faster and more effective looting.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides
       <img align="left" height="274" hspace="8" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/wu17_manage_backpack.jpg', 'lcmanager', 'width=300, height=411')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/wu17_manage_backpack_small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer;" vspace="2" width="200">
       the actual quick looting mechanism, we have implemented a possibility to manage your loot containers which&nbsp;can be accessed via the Cyclopedia, a configurable hotkey or the context menu of a container.
      </p>
      <p>
       In there,&nbsp;you can&nbsp;select a loot container of your choice and assign it to different categories like
       <em>
        default
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        gold
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        creature products, rings
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        weapons
       </em>
       . You can also assign multiple categories to the same loot container.
      </p>
      <p>
       The selected&nbsp;
       <img align="right" height="34" hspace="8" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/wu17_backpack_icon.png" vspace="0" width="34">
       loot containers&nbsp;receive&nbsp;a small icon on their bottom right side, which will&nbsp;display&nbsp;the assigned categories if you hover your mouse over it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have set up your loot containers, all items that you&nbsp;loot via the quick loot feature are going to be automatically sorted into these loot containers. Items&nbsp;that belong to unassigned categories are going to be sent to the
       <em>
        default
       </em>
       container.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two&nbsp;different types of Quick Looting:
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <strong>
        Loot All
       </strong>
       function allows you to move the entire loot from a monster corpse into your own inventory with a single left click on the corpse. The second possibility is to
       <strong>
        Loot Click
       </strong>
       within a monster body. In this case, a specific item is moved from the monster corpse into your own inventory by a single left click on the designated item.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Container&nbsp;Position Saving
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The client is now able to remember the position of your opened backpacks and windows in the sidebars. If you log out or close the client and log in again, all of your opened sidebar windows are going to be restored to the same position and size.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please keep in mind that if you log in from another computer with different sidebar settings, lower display resolution etc. the position and number of opened&nbsp;windows might vary.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have prepared a small
       FAQ
       to provide you with additional information concerning those two new features.
