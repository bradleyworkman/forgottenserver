      ith the new patch we have addressed the scam issue in the market that was reported by many players.
      <br>
      <br>
      The following adjustments have been made to make offers more clear:
      <ul>
       <li>
        If the price of a sell offer is more than 25 percent above the average market value the offer will be marked red, but only if there is enough statistical data available.
       </li>
       <li>
        If the price of a buy offer is more than 25 percent below the average market value the offer will be marked red, but only if there is enough statistical data available.
       </li>
       <li>
        Furthermore, a mouse-over shows, if the offer is dubious.
       </li>
       <li>
        In addition, the amount, the piece price, and the total price are now separated by slashes in the stand-alone client.
       </li>
       <li>
        In order to clarify the piece price of an item, the word "each" was added to all offers in the stand-alone client.
       </li>
      </ul>
      The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also
