      ue to your feedback we were able to further improve Tibia 11:
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li>
        In order to solve the problem with making an extra step when pressing a button to walk, which mainly concerned high level characters, a new option was added to the options menu. With
        <i>
         Keyboard Delay
        </i>
        you can now adjust the delay on your keystrokes in the options menu. The default delay is now set to 250 ms, while it was 0 before.
       </li>
       <li>
        Opening the dialogue to switch characters via CTR+G is now possible again if the dialogue had been closed before using ESC.
       </li>
       <li>
        The chat mode no longer automatically resets to
        <i>
         Chat Off
        </i>
        when logging out.
        <i>
         Chat On*
        </i>
        does still reset to
        <i>
         Chat Off
        </i>
        , though.
       </li>
       <li>
        The hotkey default for
        <i>
         Movement: Go South-West
        </i>
        was changed from Y to Z.
       </li>
       <li>
        The layout for long hotkey text entries was fixed.
       </li>
       <li>
        The NPC channel title should now be displayed correctly when opened via hotkey.
       </li>
       <li>
        <i>
         Player X has logged in.
        </i>
        is now also shown in the server log, if you chose
        <i>
         Notify on login.
        </i>
        on your VIP-List.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Thank you all for reporting. It helps a lot. Keep it coming!
