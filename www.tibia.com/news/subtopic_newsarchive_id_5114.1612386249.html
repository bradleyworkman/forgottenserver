        you need to
        <strong>
         log in with
        </strong>
        your registered
        <strong>
         email address
        </strong>
        and your
        <strong>
         password
        </strong>
        , both on the website and in the game. Your account name is no longer required.

      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, with today's server save, we have set the highest-levelled, unhidden character on your account as
       <strong>
        main character
       </strong>
       . This character will be used in the&nbsp;
       friend list
       &nbsp;after the release of the summer update to represent your account so that others can identify you.
      </p>
      <p>
       For accounts that only had hidden characters, a new character has been automatically created as main character. For&nbsp;those that already had 20 characters, the hidden status of the lowest-levelled character has been removed to set it as main character.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to change your main character&nbsp;you can do this
       <strong>
        for free once
       </strong>
       by using the
       <strong>
        Main Character Change&nbsp;voucher
       </strong>
       that has been assigned to your account. You can use this voucher&nbsp;in your account management page to&nbsp;choose a&nbsp;new main character.&nbsp;Please note that you cannot select characters that are hidden, scheduled for deletion or Tournament characters.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to change&nbsp;your main character again, you can purchase a&nbsp;Main Character Change in the Store. Moreover, if you create a new character, you can also set it as main character for your account.&nbsp;
