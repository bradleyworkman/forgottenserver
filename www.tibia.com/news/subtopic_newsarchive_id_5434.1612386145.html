       it is finally time to rework some of the many items found across the game. Specifically, some of the weapons are going to be changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have compiled a list with changes we plan to make on March 17. The list is available to you
       here
       , containing all adjustments. Please feel free to comment on any glaring problems you see with the new stats so that they may be addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also an
       FAQ
       available in which we address pertinent questions and detail our motivation for this endeavour. Some changes to certain items are also explained in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are also planning to introduce new best-in-slot weapons in the upcoming summer update. After the release of these current changes, there are going to be feedback forms available where you can provide your feedback regarding this topic.
