      his year's spring patch has been released!
      <img align="right" height="135" hspace="4" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/spring_patch_tree.jpg" vspace="10" width="135">
      Last week, we already announced the main
      changes
      it brings along. Here is a summary for you:
      <ul>
       <li>
        If you have never bought premium time or paid for an extra service, you are only able to post on the public Tibia boards with a character of at least level 21.
       </li>
       <li>
        The reporting system has been enhanced. You are now able to report signatures as well as forum posts, including posts on guild boards. Please note that the report of a post will not have any effect on the post itself until the report gets processed by the customer support team.
       </li>
       <li>
        The character inventory has been adjusted. Each slot is now reserved for one type of equipable item. This means you can only place items in the slots they are designed for. There is one weapon slot and one shield slot now instead of the former hand slots. The belt slot has been changed into an extra slot in which you can store ammunition or light sources. More information on the inventory can be found in the
        inventory section
        of the manual.
       </li>
       <li>
        The account management page has been polished and the information is now presented in a clearer way. Check the
        manual
        for further details on how to manage your account.
       </li>
      </ul>
      The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. If you should encounter any problems, you can alternatively
      download
      the new client 8.72 from our download section.

      See you in Tibia!
