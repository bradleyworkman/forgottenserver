       he time has finally come for the vocations to receive some adjustments! We have been collecting a lot of player feedback over time which shaped the changes we came up with, with a representative survey from last year being especially helpful, in which we asked about your opinion on current problems and challenges of the vocations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal of this project was to remedy these identified problems and sharpen the profile of the vocations, so that each of them has their particular role.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incorporating feedback does not stop here for us however, as we have invited a sizeable amount of players to an external test. While&nbsp;in-depth information is provided on the accompanying test forum, here is an overview of what is in store for you.
      </p>

        Information from Nov 18
       </strong>
       : Please note that the changes described below represent the state at the start of the test. During the test of the vocation adjustments, we made numerous improvements based on players' feedback. A detailed overview will be published on&nbsp;Nov 23, when the changes will be released.&nbsp;

        Strong mana potions for knights and challenge spell against distance fighters
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>

        Knights will finally be able to use strong mana potions, as the mana pool of high level characters has constantly grown, which made it difficult to fill up with normal potions. They will also receive a new healing spell which fills the gap between
        <em>
         Wound Cleansing
        </em>
        and
        <em>
         Intense Wound Cleansing
        </em>
        , to strengthen their healing abilities. On the other hand, while using
        <em>
         Blood Rage
        </em>
        , the knight will now take more damage, to make the spell's trade-off between attack and defense more pronounced. Knights will also get a new spell, which will temporarily turn distance fighters into melee fighters and challenge them,&nbsp;as a common criticism has been that knights do not have a good way of dealing with distance fighters.

       <strong>
        More healing options for&nbsp;druids
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Druids receive two new healing spells:
       <em>
        Nature's Embrace
       </em>
       , a stronger version of
       <em>
        Heal Friend
       </em>
       , and
       <em>
        Restoration
       </em>
       , which will be the most powerful self-healing spell. In turn,&nbsp;they can no longer use
       <em>
        Heal Friend
       </em>
       on themselves,&nbsp;as their overall healing capabilities have been strengthened. The mana costs for
       <em>
        Terra Wave
       </em>
       will also be lowered to reduce waste.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        New attack and debuff spells for sorcerers
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorcerers receive a new offensive spell,
       <em>
        Great Fire Wave
       </em>
       , which in terms of power lies between the
       <em>
        Energy Wave
       </em>
       and a
       <em>
        Fireball Rune
       </em>
       , to&nbsp;increase their attacking potential. Attack&nbsp;and critical damage of the wand of darkness will be&nbsp;lowered to curb its power. On the other hand, the sorcerer receives two completely new PvE debuff spells:
       <em>
        Expose Weakness
       </em>
       &nbsp;and
       <em>
        Sap Strength
       </em>
       . These new AoE spells weaken monsters by reducing their damage or making them more sensitive and thus provide the sorcerer with a wholly new facette to their gameplay, strengthening the&nbsp;vocation's role in a team hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something which affects both druids and sorcerers is the change of the
       <em>
        Magic Shield
       </em>
       . In its current state, it gives mages the ability to absorb a lot more damage than knights and paladins.&nbsp;The druid's and sorcerer's&nbsp;
       <em>
        Magic Shield
       </em>
       &nbsp;now only blocks a certain amount of damage before it breaks. The energy ring can now only be used by knights and paladins, but sorcerers and druids get a new item, which casts a&nbsp;
       <em>
        Magic Shield
       </em>
       &nbsp;that works like their new, modified one. With these adjustments we hope to strike a balance between giving mages a reasonable amount of protection while not&nbsp;outclassing knights and paladins in terms of defensive capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Quiver and&nbsp;elemental damage imbuements on weapons&nbsp;for&nbsp;paladins
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Paladins get a new item with the quiver, which may hold either arrows or bolts and can only be equipped by this vocation. Ammunition is no longer used out of the backpack, but solely out of the quiver. Paladins can now make use of elemental damage imbuements, since bows and crossbows&nbsp;are going to be imbueable&nbsp;with elemental damage.&nbsp;This will apply the effect to the quiver's ammunition, while it also depends on the ammunition type how this manifests. Elemental damage imbuements do not affect diamond arrows. However, speaking of diamond arrows, the cooldown of
       <em>
        Conjure Diamond Arrow
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Conjure Spectral Bolt
       </em>
       has been massively decreased down to two seconds, so that players no longer need to prepare&nbsp;ammunition a long time in advance of a hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They&nbsp;will also be able to use great mana potions, similar to how knights can use strong mana potions now. The distance skill bonus that is gotten through
       <em>
        Sharpshooter
       </em>
       has been reduced a bit, since it is widely&nbsp;considered&nbsp;as too strong by players.&nbsp;On the other hand, they receive a new spell similar to the knight's one, turning distance fighters into melee fighters,&nbsp;though it does not challenge monsters and does not affect as many creatures, combined with a longer cooldown.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Increased healing and adjusted damage range
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Intense Healing
       </em>
       and the
       <em>
        Intense Healing Rune
       </em>
       &nbsp;now heal slightly more than before, to bring them in line with the new
       <em>
        Supreme Healing
       </em>
       spell. Moreover,&nbsp;to narrow the spread of damage dealt by single target, non-critical physical range and melee attacks, their minimum damage has been increased a bit while their maximum damage has been reduced a bit.&nbsp;Overall, this does not affect the power level of players, but makes the damage output more stable.

      </p>
      <p>
       As mentioned above, in order for you to test these changes and have your say, we have launched a
       test server
       and invited a large number of players to it. The exact details, numbers and reasons for these changes can be found in the accompanying
       test forum
       . We are looking forward to you&nbsp;trying out the&nbsp;adjustments and&nbsp;giving your feedback in the respective threads to help us improve on them. We will closely follow the threads and incorporate feedback which helps in&nbsp;reaching the stated goals.
