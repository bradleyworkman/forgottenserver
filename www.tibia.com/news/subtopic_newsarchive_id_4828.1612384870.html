       he winter update has now been released and brings many new challenges to Tibia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Become part of an ancient elfish conflict between the summer and winter court and enter the magical
       realm of dreams
       . Once united, the world of these wondrous dream elves was defiled and divided by envy and strife. Face invading, nightmarish creatures and use all your strength to prevent the nightmare from coming true.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, not only the elfish dream world is getting invaded by spooky, creepy monsters.
       Supernatural creatures
       are also wreaking havoc in several ancient ruins scattered around Tibia. True horror and challenging puzzles are waiting for ambitious ghostbusters. Can you solve them all and gain access to the spectres' buried shelter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not forget to take a trip into the jungle of Tiquanda in order to provide your services to a grumpy, greedy dwarf. This charmless little fellow might be the only one who can shine some light on the story behind the broken compass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, a new, annual returning, questline called
       Winterlight Solstice
       has been implemented. The quest will be accessible as of December 22, a dedicated news with more information and final&nbsp;details will follow soon.

       The Cyclopedia received a new feature, which provides a detailed overview on your character stats as well as the combat stats of your equipped gear. Besides that, the
       Character Information
       can be used to look up and sort your character's achievements and to display your recent deaths and PvP kills in the client.
      </p>
      <p>
       New
       quality of life features
       have found their way into the client as well. Many items are now stackable and can therefore be stowed in the Supply Stash. The new trader filter option in the stash allows you to list only stowed items that are being purchased by the selected NPC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, items are now highlighted with a coloured frame, which allows to identify the approximate value of the item at a glance. The frames can be changed to smaller corners or completely disabled in the Interface options.
      </p>
      <p>
       From now on, upon each server save, a randomly selected Prey creature will be boosted: A boosted creature yields double XP, double loot and has its respawn rate increased by 2x till the next server save. The currently boosted creature is displayed in the login screen of your client and has replaced the
       <em>
        Monster of the Week
       </em>
       on our
       website
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a new imbuement called
       Vibrancy
       that can remove existing paralyse effects with a certain chance whenever a paralyse attack is launched at the wearer of the imbuement. In addition, the cooldown of the paralyse rune was raised to six seconds. Due to raised concerns, we have removed&nbsp;a&nbsp;reflection component from the imbuement.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some changes that were not explicitly announced in previous teasers and were also not available during our test servers:
      </p>
      <p>
       A brand-new event calendar, which can be found in the redesigned login screen of your client and in the&nbsp;
       news section
       &nbsp;of our website, informs you on currently active and upcoming events in Tibia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, we have reworked the character selection screen, which now provides more information, like the level and vocation of each character as well as the character's current outfit.
       <br>
       Last but not least, some of the new items (valuables) were added to the loot of the secret library bosses, which&nbsp;should make beating them more profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       We hope you enjoy the content of the new winter update and wish you a lot of fun in Tibia,
