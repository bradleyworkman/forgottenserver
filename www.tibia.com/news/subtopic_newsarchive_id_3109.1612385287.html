       You are a fan of puppetry? You like to travel the world together with one or two little acting fellows? Or are you simply the one who likes to pull the strings? Then the brand-new
       <b>
        puppeteer
       </b>
       outfit might be the right choice for you.
       <br>
       Or are you more the kind of human who wants to live in accord with the nature? You are in love with the deep soul of Mother Earth and prefer to walk in the shadows of her wooden children? Then the
       <b>
        spirit caller
       </b>
       outfit will suit you best.
       <br>
       <br>
       Once bought and assigned to one of your characters, you can wear the outfit ingame anytime, no matter if you are a free account or a premium account. This outfit is purely cosmetic and does not bestow any benefits.

       Dress up!
