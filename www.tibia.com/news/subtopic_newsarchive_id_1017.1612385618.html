      n this week's update teaser, we would like to inform you about a couple of further changes that this year's summer update will bring.
      <br>
      <br>

      There will be changes in
      <b>
       raids
      </b>
      . The Horned Fox and Demodras, for example, have decided to vary their behaviour a bit. They might surprise you in different areas now, so be careful.
      <br>
      <br>
      Also, from now on, you will be able to participate in two
      <b>
       new events
      </b>
      . Already in August, you can become an assistant of Jean Pierre, who is a true chef. If you are worthy, he will share some of his most secret recipes with you. He creates dishes you would have never dreamed of. Eating some of his delicious meals will have really astonishing side effects. They are so amazing that you can only prepare them once by yourself during the following year if you have successfully completed your apprenticeship. For example, one meal causes your muscles to grow and your melee fighting skills to enhance temporarily. Another meal will refill all your mana at once. You do not have to worry about forgetting the recipes you learn from Jean Pierre, since he will give you a cookbook as well.
      <br>
      When Jean Pierre comes back next year, you can visit him again and brush up on your cooking abilities. You will then be able to cook his wonderful dishes once again.
      <br>

      <br>
      While you can participate in the cooking event all by yourself, you will have to team up with others for the next event. In November, when winter is around the corner, deadly shadows threaten the lands of Tibia. Demonic and evil creatures are lurking in the dark corners, ready to attack. Light is the only protection Tibian inhabitants have against these creatures. You and your friends can help preventing attacks from these dark and evil beings if you manage to keep ten lights burning for five days.
      <br>
      If only one light goes out, you have failed and all evil will break lose in Tibia for half a day. If you succeed, something great will come your way instead... It is really worth trying to keep the citizens of Tibia safe.

      Some of you might remember the
      <b>
       backpack
      </b>
      event in March 2009. Participants of the
      backpack poll
      have determined that there should be a crown backpack, a demon backpack and a moon backpack in Tibia. Angus and Mortimer will be happy to sell the crown backpack to you if you have done the Explorer Society quest already. To receive the demon backpack and the moon backpack, you need to show great patience. Also, a good portion of luck is necessary, before you can call the moon backpack your own.
      <br>
      In addition to these three new backpacks we have added orange backpacks as well, since the
      thread for the backpack event
      was started with this wish, and received much support from many players. These new orange backpacks and orange bags will be sold in Thais from now on.
      <br>
      <br>
      After the update, you will also finally be able to open up the
      <b>
       mysterious packages
      </b>
      that you have received in the secret service quest. Whatever you will find in this package will surely come in handy in some situations...
      <br>

      <img align="right" height="109" hspace="10" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/amulets.jpg" width="111">
      <br>
      In addition to all this, there will also be a couple of
      <b>
       new amulets
      </b>
      . They basically work like the stone skin amulet, but instead of death damage protection they will grant you protection from different elements. Thus you will be able to withstand monsters dealing strong elemental damage much better.
      <br>
      <br>
      Also, since many mages have complained that their
      <b>
       spell books
      </b>
      are too heavy, the book covers are now made of a different material that is very light, but not less robust.
      <br>
      <br>
      We have also added a
      <b>
       Server Log
      </b>
      channel to the chat console, as many of you have suggested as an improvement. The original default channel will be split into two channels. You will still see everything that other players say around you in your default channel, however, all other information will be displayed in the Server Log channel. For example, your last login date, the damage your character takes, the damage your character and your summons deal, and the loot of monsters.
      <br>
      <br>
      Since the admins and the helpers of our
      supported and promoted fansites
      have already had a glimpse at the update on the test server, you will find further information, screenshots and even videos there.
      <br>
      <br>
      We hope you will enjoy these changes!
