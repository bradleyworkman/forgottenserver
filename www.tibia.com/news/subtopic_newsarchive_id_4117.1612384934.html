       noopy Moony squinted. It was bright daylight!

        Hard to believe... It felt like she had dozed off just a couple minutes ago. It had been deepest night. She had been sitting outside, watching the day come to an end when a tiredness had overcome her.
        <br>
        <br>
        Boy, did she have a vivid dream. Talking to animals was nothing new to her, but this time it had been wild. She was wary... this felt so real!
        <br>
        <br>
        In her dream she had made the acquaintance of a white deer named Alkestios, she had assisted a snake called Ikassis and she had helped out a magnificent white swan. Even now she could sense a close connection to these animals. They still seemed to be just as real to her as her ivory fang Truly Dooly... but a bit different, nonetheless.
        <br>
        <br>
        She recalled that in her dream she had somehow earned the trust of shy nature spirits, the Fae, who had welcomed her into their protected and hidden space. What a beautiful and amazing place that had been! But - something had felt different to her there. Pondering the dream, she suddenly knew what had felt so odd: Creatures she had seen there during the day had been gone at night, and creatures she had seen there at night had not crossed her path during daytime. Quite different from what she is used to... Also the place had an awing glow to it at night... pretty amazing. Could all this have been real?

      <p>
       Being highly sensitive nature spirits, the Fae could sense that the magical world was undergoing changes. Evil had become a lot more influential and posed a threat to the magical barrier that had protected them. They had been rattled by these developments. Even some of their own kin had turned to the darker side, and nightmarish creatures, who could easily be kept at bay in the past, were intruding their protective space.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Fae had reached out for help, and Snoopy was more than happy to respond. She had felt proud that somebody turned to her for protection. What a good feeling! A bit weird, too, though, because this usually does not happen to her. So - maybe this was just an illusion created by her vivid imagination after all, no matter how real it felt.
       <br>
       She recalled that she had also experienced some really strange adventures. For example, she remembered helping the tooth fairy and talking to trees and rocks... this was indeed all way too wild. She was

        almost

       certain now that it had all just been a dream...

        Premonition or dream...?
