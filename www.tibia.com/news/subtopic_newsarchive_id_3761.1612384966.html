       decided to confront the priests. "What are you doing here?" he asked.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
       The priests did not seem to be surprised by his appearance and answered friendly: "We are arranging everything. Day by day, dark forces are getting stronger! But do not despair, the gods have decided to help us. We, who have been chosen to introduce the Tibian heroes into the long forgotten secrets of the
       <em>
        Astral Shapers
       </em>
       , are preparing the
       <em>
        Halls of Hope

       ? What are
       <em>
        Astral Shapers
       </em>
       ?" Alon had never heard of them before.
       <br>
       "Once, they were an ancient civilisation praised with an incredible knowledge that had reached its cultural climax during the ages of the God Wars. After their high civilisation got destroyed, the
       <em>
        Astral Shapers
       </em>
       lost their former power and glory.

       Those who survived, withdrew to secret hideouts and turned their backs on our world. Only little remained from their once glorious places and until recently it seemed like the
       <em>
        Astral Shapers
       </em>
       died with their knowledge long ago. Fortunately, our newest insights showed that at least some of their ancient sites are still intact.
       <br>
       As soon as the
       <em>
        Halls of Hope
       </em>
       are rebuilt, we will be able to introduce you to the great accomplishments of their culture. Only if the temple regains its ancient glory, you will be able to learn the highest art of
       <em>
        imbuing
       </em>
       ."
       <br>
       <br>
       "What is
       <em>
        imbuing
       </em>
       ?" Alon asked while he wrinkled his forehead.
       <br>
       "The ultimate power of the
       <em>
        Astral Shapers
       </em>
       was the ability to forge magical bindings onto items. Once completed, these halls will give you access to their ancient hideouts. But be careful, over the centuries those in hiding slowly degenerated and their descendants are as far away from their ancestor's civilised behaviour as you can only imagine. If you are worthy enough though, you will be able to bind powerful imbuements to your equipment."
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       This being said, only one single question was preying on Alon's mind: "Tell me, how many of their ancient sites do still exist?"
