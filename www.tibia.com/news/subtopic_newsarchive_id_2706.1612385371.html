       ear ye! Hear ye! An icy bridge reaches toward an isle of frost and hidden fire, with cold-hearted monsters grim and dire.

      A cold storm is coming from the north. The howling wind whispers stories of an old and forgotten frozen island - unreachable for ages. What was once a lush and beautiful paradise is now an everlasting ice desert dominated by various kinds of monsters. Deep down inside the isle and locked in ice, a once so proud race - the ursagrodon Â– is sleeping and vigilantly waiting to be freed again...
      <br>
      <br>
      Tibians, a new place to explore is waiting for you but only temporarily. From April 03 until May 03, a new isle called Chyllfroest will be accessible. West of Svargrond, an icy bridge will form within the next days, and will grant access to Chyllfroest for all premium players. You will find different dungeons with various creatures for different level ranges. If you are going deeper, you might find one of the frozen ursagrodons which can be tamed with some luck. In addition, rumour has it that yetis are roaming around there as well.
      <br>
      <br>
      Enjoy spring, froest is coming...
