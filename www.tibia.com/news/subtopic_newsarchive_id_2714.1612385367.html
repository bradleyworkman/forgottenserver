      ith today's server save we implemented a new and faster way to get premium status from within the game for both clients, the
      <b>
       <i>
        Get Premium
       </i>
      </b>
      button.
      <br>
      <br>
      A new widget can be found under your inventory in the stand-alone client and above your inventory in the Tibia Flash client. Furthermore, you will find a little icon, a crown, next to your purse icon in both clients. Using the crown will enable or disable the
      <b>
       <i>
        Get Premium
       </i>
      </b>
      widget if you are a premium player or if you already bought premium time in the past.
      <center>
       <img height="69" hspace="4" onclick="window.open('http://static.tibia.com/images/news/premiumbuttonnews.png', 'premium button', 'width=490, height=399')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/premiumbuttonnews_thumb.png" style="cursor: pointer;" width="194">

       <i>
        Please click on the graphic.
       </i>
      </center>
      <br>
      The widget will also appear automatically if your premium time is about to expire.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you click on the
      <b>
       <i>
        Get Premium
       </i>
      </b>
      button you will be directly forwarded to the corresponding page of your account management if you are already logged in on the website. In case you are not logged in yet, you will be asked to enter your data now.

      Along with this new feature we implemented some content fixes and changes:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Players now receive a message when using frozen starlight on Yakchal's empty coffin.
       </li>
       <li>
        In case of a world transfer, only 100 pieces of cluster of solace can now be transferred to the new game world.
       </li>
       <li>
        The reward mechanism was added to Tanjis, Jaul, and Obujos. Please note, that the chests there still work as before.
       </li>
       <li>
        We addressed a small issue with the look of the male and female druid outfit.
       </li>
       <li>
        Some walls in the houses Lair and Lost Cavern can now be decorated.
       </li>
       <li>
        The dream warden outfit is now accessible as intended.
       </li>
       <li>
        NPC Robson now also sells labels in addition to parcels.
       </li>
       <li>
        Last but not least, some map issues and typos have been fixed as well.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Together with these changes, a new client version will be available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.38 from our
      download section
      .
