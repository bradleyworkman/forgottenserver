      urray Tibians! The waiting is over, it is finally here: please welcome this year's Christmas update. Sharpen your weapons, stock up with runes, put on your best dress and get ready to set out on new adventures!
      <br>
      <br>
      There is a whole
      new continent
      waiting for you. East of Vengoth, the dwarfs have built an underground base camp called Farmine which can be reached via steamboats. It is a good starting point for all adventurers who are brave enough to venture out to explore the new land Zao, full of challenges and dangers. Prepare to face countless enemies,
      fearsome creatures
      never seen before and discover long forgotten secrets. Witness how the dark fate of an ancient civilisation slowly unveils in the course of your daring travels,
      missions and quests
      . Earn the right to wear a prestigious
      warmaster outfit
      , find precious new items, collect tomes of knowledge, join the siege of a city, fight in a big tournament on the mysterious Isle of Strife and become part of a resistance against the horrible threat that plagues this land. Who can stand the evil that flows thick through the veins of Zao? Who can bear the dark presence feasting on the energy and life of every living being there? Tibians, Zao needs you to withstand the perils at hand! It is a time for heroes so do not hesitate and help the exotic country to avert a disaster, to overcome the seemingly inevitable doom.
      <br>
      <br>
      Adventurers who prefer to stay in already explored areas will also find many new items to discover. Many monsters in Tibia now drop new
      loot items
      and some of the old heavy items will be removed instead. The new loot items are not only lighter and stackable but also yield a better, or at least the same selling price like the removed items. Also, we have decreased or exchanged the food drops in most monsters, especially in easy monsters that dropped huge piles of meat or ham before. So chop some monsters to check out the loot changes.
      <br>
      Also, we sneaked a peek in Ruprecht's hut and spotted some splendid new things which he is probably willing to exchange for Christmas tokens.

      Back in November, we implemented the so-called snap-backs on all game worlds due to the introduction of the no-blocking gameplay feature on Optional PvP worlds. Based on the extensive feedback we received after the autumn patch, we have decided to make some
      adjustments
      . From now on, they only happen when it is actually possible to stack into the other creature, character or object. That means snap-backs no longer occur on Open and Hardcore PvP worlds. On Optional PvP worlds, stacks and snap-backs only occur with other characters that are not involved in a guild war with you, with summoned creatures of such characters and also with magic walls and wild growth made by such characters.
      <br>
      <br>
      With the update, the borders of the following houses, which are all adjacent to water, have been changed back to like they were before the last summer update: Fibula Villa, Greenshore Villa, Carlin Lonely Sea Side Hostel, Carlin Clanhall, Carlin East Lane 2, Thais Upper Swamp Lane 12 and Cormaya 5. The river or sea borders now belong officially to the house again. Thus, items can be placed on them and will not disappear during an update map reset. Also, the old rental price has been restored.
      <br>
      <br>
      We also have some interesting news for those of you who took part in the Lightbearer Event in November and helped to keep the lights burning long enough to drive away the evil forces that were threatening Tibia. While building a new ore wagon tunnel near the Kazordoon main entrance, the dwarves discovered a strange room and guess who they met inside! Lucius! It seems that many wealthy people sent him gifts of gratitude for saving their world. The dwarves tried to convince Lucius to hand those treasures over to them but good old Lucius knows quite well that those of you who helped to keep the basins burning actually deserve these rewards.
So you should really pay him a visit if you helped your game world to succeed. Just purchase an ore wagon ticket as usual and stop by Lucius' treasure room. Besides a Fafnar statue in the room that allows you to claim the silver or golden trophy from the Lightbearer event, if you have not received it yet, you can also find 4 reward chests there which are accessible for everyone who has lit at least one basin on one of the 19
      winning worlds
      . Characters who have lit all ten basins on one of the winning worlds can access 3 further reward chests. If you still have some midnight shards left, just take them along with you and hand them over to Lucius to exchange them.
      <br>
      <br>
      To cut a long story short: Check out the new awesome content! The update will download automatically when you log into the game. If you should encounter any problems, you can alternatively
      download
      the new client 8.54 from our download section. Tomorrow, December 10, we are going to start a dedicated feedback thread for the update on our discussion board.
      <br>
      <br>
      Enjoy the Christmas update!
