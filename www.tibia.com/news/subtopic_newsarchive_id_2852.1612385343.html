      ith today's server save, the announced changes of the upcoming world event
      Rise of Devovorga
      have been implemented. Due to feedback we received during the public test, the time interval concerning stage 3 has been adjusted: If your world has successfully completed stage 2, stage 3 will be initiated sometime between 8 and 14 hours after the next server save.
      <br>
      Additionally, the achievement
      <i>
       Devovorga's Nemesis
      </i>
      will now be granted to all players who significantly contributed to bringing her down in the final fight. While the achievement can now be obtained by several players on a world per year instead of just one, it will still remain rare and requires considerable effort.
      <br>
      <br>
      Also, the world change "Their Master's Voice" is now accessible again. Furthermore, we implemented a few content fixes. For example:
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>
       The shield modifier of moohtant cudgels were removed and the defence value was raised by +1.
      </li>
      <li>
       Forbidden Fruits task (Northern Zao): We fixed an issue that prevented some players from continuing and completing this task. The keyword "collect" now allows these players to take up the task again.
      </li>
      <li>
       A bunch of map bugs, typos and several minor graphical glitches were fixed. Also, a few erroneous or incomplete NPC texts were adjusted.
      </li>
      <br>
      Besides, a PvP issue with summons was addressed: If you call a summon from now on in a place that would force it to appear far away - on a different ground level, or on the other end of a teleporter, for example, it will refuse your request and disappear again if the place on the other end is already occupied by other players.

      Enjoy!
