       In total, 8 new combinations are up for grabs with prices ranging from 13.95 EUR to 29.95 EUR.

       If your character is into dark magic, the
       <b>
        chaos acolyte
       </b>
       outfit is a perfect way to express your inner nature. Those who do not mind the smell of decay and the thick claws of a vulture may prefer the grim
       <b>
        death herald
       </b>
       outfit, though.
       <br>
       <br>
       In order to get a better idea of how these outfits will look ingame, head over to the
       <i>
        Outfits
       </i>
       section in the payment system and simply place your mouse pointer over an outfit to start a walking animation that will show you both the female and male version from all directions.
       <br>
       <br>
       Once bought and assigned to one of your characters, you can wear the outfit ingame anytime, no matter if you are a free account or a premium account. Please note that these outfits are purely cosmetic and do not bestow any benefits.
