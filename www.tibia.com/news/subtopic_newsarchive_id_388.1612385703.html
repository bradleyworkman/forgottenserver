      s part of our weekly update teaser series, we will let you sneak a peek today at some of the many new hunting grounds that will be available to all
      premium
      players after the summer update. If you are a brave adventurer and you are eager to free the world of some evil creatures, the Shattered Isles are the place you are looking for. Lesser-experienced characters will enjoy hunting the exotic creatures that dwell on the idyllic Laguna Islands. For those of you who prefer a more traditional challenge we recommend the dungeons below Liberty Bay, which are crawling with unsavoury rotworms. Take a look at the re-designed rotworms and their awesome big cousins, the carrion worms!

      Mid- and high-level characters will find great hunting opportunities at the Forbidden Islands. Unfortunately, this mysterious archipelago is very difficult to find. The few sailors who set foot on these islands and lived to tell the tale were shipwrecked off the treacherous coast, their half-dead bodies washed ashore during one of the terrible thunderstorms that torment the South Seas. All kind of exotic monsters await adventurers on the 5 isles which make up this archipelago. Of course, there will also be a great variety of new creatures to fight, but this is another story that will be told some other day ....
