      oday we have done several minor bugfixes at the map and some maintenance at all game servers. We are sorry for the unexpected long downtime.
      <p>
       The
       maps section
       has been updated and includes now all new and changed areas of Tibia.
       <p>
        The work on the new client is progressing fast with the great help of our test team consisting of counsellors and gamemasters. We expect to present a public test in the next time. Just watch the news for more details.
        <p>
         Finally we want to remind you that the very last chance to register for the
         Tibia Convention 2002
         is tomorrow, Friday, July the 5th.
         <p>
          Enjoy Tibia!
