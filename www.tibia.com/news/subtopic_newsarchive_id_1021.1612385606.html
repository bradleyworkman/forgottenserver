      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      First of all, the legendary city of
      <b>
       Carlin
      </b>
      has undergone a
      fundamental revamp
      . It is now a true symbol of female elegance and has regained its medieval and dignified charm. The Carlin castle shines again in all its glory, so does Edron's castle which has been renovated together with several guildhalls and houses in and around
      <b>
       Edron
      </b>
      and
      <b>
       Thais
      </b>
      . Stop by as soon as your journey takes you past these cities. With their renewed looks they are really worth a visit.
      <br>
      <br>
      Plenty of new
      quests
      are available for brave Tibian souls. Those who just started out their adventurer career are advised to do the
      <b>
       Pilgrimage of Ashes
      </b>
      , a guided round trip tour to meet five of the famous givers of blessings. Others might be interested in helping Eclesius, the
      <b>
       scatterbrained sorcerer
      </b>
      , with some of his most important tasks. He pays well and also rewards his helpers with some precious experience.
      <br>
      The more experienced adventurers can prove themselves by retrieving long lost artefacts of golem technology, and thereby facing the dangerous
      <b>
       Shadows of Yalahar
      </b>
      . Furthermore, Rapanaio, the dwarf, has some very weird stories to tell. Will you be courageous enough to set a foot on the
      <b>
       Isle of Evil
      </b>
      ?
      <br>
      <br>
      Moreover, a couple of
      new tasks
      are being offered by some elected citizens. They are looking for adventurers who help them fight threatening monster hordes that roam the lands. But be careful: you might take the risk to face the monsters' powerful bosses during your hunt!
      <br>
      <br>
      Two new
      events
      are going to take place this year. In August,
      <b>
       Jean Pierre
      </b>
      , a true chef, is ready to share his most secret recipes with you. With his help you will be able to prepare some really delicate dishes which have quite amazing effects for the ones who eat them. Later, in November, the
      <b>
       Lightbearer Event
      </b>
      will take place, a huge spectacle that requires many people to actually work together. Your mission is to keep ten lights which are scattered throughout Tibia burning for five days. If you fail, evil will break loose and threaten Tibia's inhabitants.
      <br>
      <br>
      Some very important modifications were made concerning the
      PvP system on regular PvP worlds
      . We removed the Tibia rule called "Player Killing", which was formerly rule number 5. Instead of banishing accounts for excessive unjustified player killing, we introduce the
      <b>
       black skull
      </b>
      which is a character-based ingame punishment. Characters that are marked with a black skull are neither able to target unmarked characters nor to use aggressive area spells or runes.
      <br>
      Furthermore, the
      <b>
       kill count
      </b>
      has been changed: the last 20 damage dealers who have done damage within the last 60 seconds before the death of a character are now being counted as killers and get displayed and linked on the character information page of the victim.
      <br>
      Other modifications were made with regards to
      <b>
       protection zones
      </b>
      : players who defend themselves from the attacks of other players do not get a protection zone block anymore. Having a protection zone block is being displayed by a new symbol: two crossed red blades, similar to the logout block symbol. Another new symbol is the white dove, signalising that you are standing within a protection zone.
      <br>
      <br>
      Eternal protection to those who tie the knot cannot be guaranteed, though. However, the
      bond of life
      has become a reality now in Tibia, and all the best shall happen to the ones who decide to spend their Tibian lifes together. In Venore, you can buy beautiful wedding outfits and rings. With the right items at hand, either travel to Thais, Ab'Dendriel or Kazordoon to celebrate a wonderful marriage ceremony with your sweetheart. After that, take your time and enjoy an unforgettable and well-deserved honeymoon on the romantic island of Meluna.

      <br>
      Fearless hunters find new
      hunting grounds
      near Beregar and Liberty Bay, as well as some newly discovered amazing waterfalls in Tiquanda's underground areas. In the North of Darashia vicious beasts burn the grounds of a foremost hidden dungeon, so be aware of their breath of fire. Treasure Island, Demona, the Ankrahmun tombs and many more areas also have a new and spiced up look, so make sure to pay them a visit.
      <br>
      <br>
      The
      monster balancing
      has been improved by changing the loot, behaviour, and strength of several Tibian creatures like, for example, hellspawns, water elementals, wisps, sea serpents, werewolves, fire devils, gargoyles, goblins, and many more.
      <b>
       Medusa
      </b>
      is a brandnew and powerful monster which has been unleashed with the summer update. Be careful if you come across a wild looking creature whose hair style is made of snakes.
      <br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, a dozen new
      bosses
      have settled down in Tibia, for example Fahim the Wise, Esmeralda, The Many, or The Noxious Spawn. For others, like Demodras or The Horned Fox, alternative raid locations have been added that make them more difficult to find.
      <br>
      <br>
      Some
      new equipment
      is also part of this update. Following the community's will we now introduce the demon backpack, crown backpack, and moon backpack. Several new amulets protect you from different kinds of elemental damage, and, finally, the mysterious packages which you receive in the secret service quest can now be opened. They contain quite interesting tools which might be useful in some special occasions.
      <br>
      <br>
      Moreover,
      <b>
       Rashid
      </b>
      and some other NPCs are now willing to buy many more items from you. Stop by and ask them for a trade if you want to know more about it.
      <br>
      <br>
      Last but not least, we added a new channel to the chat console which displays some of the messages that were formerly shown in the default channel. The
      server log channel
      keeps you updated with damage and loot messages, among others. Loot messages are displayed in green colour in order to set them apart from the rest of the channel information.
      <br>
      <br>
      Further pictures and screenshots of this update can be found on our
      promoted and supported fansites
      , which are a good place to visit.
      <br>
      <br>
      When you log into the game after our service is back online, your client will update itself automatically. Alternatively, you can
      download
      the new Tibia client 8.5.
      <br>

      <b>
       Tomorrow, July 2nd, 2009, we are going to start a dedicated feedback thread for the PvP changes in this update. Please use the general news feedback thread to discuss any other update topics with us. Thank you!
