      ately, we were able to address a lot of issues due to your feedback. Today, we released another round of fixes for Tibia 11.
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li>
        We improved the visibility of the health bar. Numeric effects should no longer cover the bar.
       </li>
       <li>
        Containers (e.g. backpacks) now close without delay.
       </li>
       <li>
        To improve its visibility, the mouse cursor was brightened up.
       </li>
       <li>
        Left Smart-Click now opens a container in the same window. Additionally, ALT+Left Smart-Click opens a container in a new window now.
       </li>
       <li>
        Monsters and NPCs displayed in the battle window are now listed in the correct order.
       </li>
       <li>
        Further improvements concerning
        <i>
         turning with CTRL
        </i>
        while moving.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Thank you all for reporting. It helps a lot. Keep it coming!
