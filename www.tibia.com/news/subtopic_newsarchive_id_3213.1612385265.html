        Notes:
       </b>
       <br>
       Today I met the ferryman Cornell. He offers a ferry service from Edron to the small island Grimvale, where were-creatures are striking terror into people's hearts. On the isle, I found Maeryn, an inhabitant, who told me a bit more about this place and who gave me a book to understand what is going on here. Even after having read it, this were-curse continues to be a mystery...
       <br>
       <br>
       Once again, I went underground to explore this dangerous place in the hope to find an explanation for all of this. Both, Maeryn and Cornell have warned me not to get bitten by those creatures, or I will turn into one of them... so I was extremely careful.
       <br>

       It is indeed threatening down there. Many different were-creatures are roaming around in a deep and long tunnel system.
       <br>
       After some hours of exploring the area, I found a magic forcefield, but I was not able to pass it. Maybe that has something to do with the current moon phase? I will send a copy of the book to the Adventurers' Guild. They will know what to do. Meanwhile, I will continue my mission and visit other places on Edron...
