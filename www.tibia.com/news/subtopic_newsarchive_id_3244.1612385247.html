      the waiting is over and the summer update 2015 has been released.
      <br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, due to some unexpected internal delays, the test server had started later as planned this time. The long break between the end of the teasers and the start of the test server required indeed a lot of your patience. Before giving you a short summary of the update, we want to thank you again for all your passion and support during the teaser and test time!
      <br>
      <br>
      And now let us start:
      <br>
      <br>
      The Adventurers Guild
      is looking for volunteers to chart the map of Tibia. Many unknown, unexplored areas and dungeons can be discovered all over Tibia. But be warned! You may not be able to master every challenge! Make sure to be well prepared if you want to visit the new
      hero
      dungeon in Edron or if you try to lift the secret of
      Grimvale
      , to name just two examples.

      <br>
      Besides lots of new content,
      further update stuff
      is waiting for you as well.
      <br>
      As proposed by players, new
      achievements for ingame mounts
      and
      more sellable items
      have been added to the game.
      <br>
      Due to valid concerns players raised about the announced damage decrease of runes made by NPCs, we decided to cancel this change. Your input and feedback made it clear that such an adjustment of runes requires more intensive preparatory work and a more far-sighted approach. There are no concrete plans at the moment if or when we will take up this topic again, though. In any case, we would like to thank all of you who took the time to provide us with constructive and elaborated feedback on this matter.
      <br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, a book listing the
      eight new wonders of the Tibian world
      has been added to the Isle of the Kings' library. The NPC Jorge offers three new replicas in exchange for some silver raid tokens. Last but not least, the teleport to the shaburak and askarak demons as well as the teleport to Fazzrah have been moved to make it easier for players to reach both places.
      <br>
      <br>
      In addition to the summer update, we have also released the new Tibian currency
      <b>
       Tibia Coins
      </b>
      and the ingame
      <b>
       Store
      </b>
      to provide you with a more convenient way to spice up your Tibia experience through various products such as Premium Time, extra services for your character, mounts and outfits. If you want to read more about this important new feature, have a look at our
      featured article
      . Further information on Tibia Coins, the Store and the Webshop can also be found in the updated
      manual
      .
      <br>
      <br>
      The update will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also
      download
      the new stand-alone client version 10.80 from our download section. Please note that the download of the client will take longer than usual.
      <br>
      <br>
      Enjoy the summer!
