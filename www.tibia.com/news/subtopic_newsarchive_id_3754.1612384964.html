      was early in the evening and Alon was on his way to meet some friends at the local pub.
      <i>
       "Have you heard? Two new faces showed up in town,"
      </i>
      Alon asked as he joined them at Frodo's tavern. Nemuk frowned:
      <i>
       "Of course I have, there is no way you can miss them, their clothes and the guy's beard are quite striking. Looking like priests or something." "I've heard they are part of some really strange cult, better stay away from them,"
      </i>
      an obviously drunken knight from the next table barked loudly.
      <br>
      <i>
       "Easy easy, we don't know nothing so far. Let's not jump to conclusions here,"
      </i>
      Alon tried to quieten the suspicions.
      <i>
       "Has anyone of you even talked to them already?"
      </i>
      The whole table lowered their heads and after a short time of awkward silence they devoted the rest of the night to other subjects.
      <br>
      <br>
      It was one of those days when the beer tasted particularly good to Alon and as he finally called it a night, the streets on his way home were eerily empty. He was strolling along the city walls when two figures caught his eye. Equipped with shovels and pickaxes they hushed through the north gate of the town.
      <br>
      <i>
       "Well, I'll be damned if those two aren't the new guys we have been talking about earlier on... But what are they doing outside the walls at this time of the day?"
      </i>
      he wondered.
      <br>
      Driven by his curious but careful nature he stuck to their heels keeping a safe distance and sought shelter behind a nearby tree as soon as they stopped on a huge clearing not far away from the city. The area looked like a recently started excavation site as he could recognise some ancient looking stonewalls.
      <br>
      <br>
      They were talking to each other and he tried to eavesdrop on the conversation but he was too far away. He could only overhear the word
      <i>
       "Hope"
      </i>
      . While they began to dig he got more courageous and sneaked around the site.
      <i>
       "They really do look like priests,"
      </i>
      he ascertained but got pulled out of his thoughts as all of a sudden a song raised through the silence of the night:
      <i>
       "Earth, fire, holy, ice, we'll find the ruins next to Thais! Energy and death will help us too, to fight the evil coming through!"
      </i>
