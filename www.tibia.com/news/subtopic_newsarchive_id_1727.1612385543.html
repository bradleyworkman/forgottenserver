      ibians, the Beta Flash client has been released! So if you are curious, you can now use it to play Tibia on the regular game worlds.
      <br>
      <br>
      The Beta Flash client already includes many cool features such as customisable sidebars, action bars and hotkey sets, battle list options, and a heads-up display, for example. Please note, though, that this client is still a beta version as the name indicates. This means, it is still in full development, glitches and bugs are to be expected, and not everything works fine and smooth yet. So please understand that you are using it on your own risk.
      <br>
      <br>
      Beta version also means that we are continuously working on fixing issues, and on developing and improving the Flash client further based on your wishes. So there are still many things on our to-do-list, both bug fixes as well as suggestions on how to make the client better. We intend to address all relevant points step by step, and we hope that you will help us by continuing to give us constructive feedback. You can find further information on issues that have been fixed since the end of the open beta in the
      Auditorium
      .

      If you want to play Tibia with the Beta Flash client, you need to log into your account page and click on the button "Join Beta" in the box above your character list. For further information on minimum system requirements, controls and game settings please carefully read the new manual section about the
      Beta Flash client
      . We also added a couple of answers concerning the Flash client in the
      FAQ
      section.
      <br>
      <br>
      We also want to emphasise again, that if you prefer to play Tibia with the stand-alone client, you are free to use it just as before.
      <br>
      <br>
      Enjoy!
