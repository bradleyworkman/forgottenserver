      time again! The teaser time and the test phase are over and the Tibia summer update 2014 has just been released.
Before you start exploring the new stuff, we would like to give you a short summary of what to expect.
      <br>
      <br>
      A new and unknown island has been discovered. Lots of challenges, monsters, and quests are waiting for you there.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you ask Captain Bluebear in Thais for a passage to Oramond he will ship you to the new isle in the East. Once there, a special slime slide system will transport you from the harbour to the island. Don't be scared! The slide feels indeed a bit oozy.
      <br>
      Nearby, the city of Rathleton is waiting for you, but be warned! Nasty monsters will not let you reach the town too easily. Strong and tall minotaurs are claiming parts of the island as their home and will give you a hard time if you want to wander around alone and without help. In general, Oramond is a dangerous area. Lots of new
      creatures
      are ready to test your fighting skills. Not only new kinds of minotaurs, but also metal gargoyles, rustheap and glooth golems, devourers, blood beasts, and many more will try to kill you.

      <br>
      The city of
      Rathleton
      is divided in several parts. Some quarters and the sewers are full of threats but the city has a lot more to offer. New rentable houses and guildhalls are available in
      Upper Rathleton
      . So make sure to be ready when the bidding starts. Do not miss your chance to call one of the pretty new houses your home! Furthermore, you can now earn voting rights ingame and thereby participate in Rathleton's decision making. For example, you can choose between different dungeons with different creatures or vote for certain boss fights. Your
      vote
      matters!
      <br>
      Of course, many quests, several bosses, new equipment, a new
      outfit and a new mount
      are waiting for you as well.
      <br>
      <br>
      In addition to the new area, we changed and adjusted the shared experience to make it more attractive for you to hunt with your friends. Gather your mates, call your guild, meet new comrades and try it out!
      <br>
      <br>
      And last but not least, you will find some new varying monster spawns on Oramond that will make your hunting experience more thrilling.
      <br>
      The improved animations that are currently being tested on the test servers will be released within the next weeks.
      <br>
      <br>
      The update will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also
      download
      the new stand-alone client version 10.50 from our download section. Please note that the download of the client will take longer than usual.
      <br>
      <br>
      Oramond is calling!
