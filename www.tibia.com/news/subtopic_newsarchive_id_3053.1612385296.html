      n order to protect your account against unauthorised access,
      <img align="right" height="139" hspace="4" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/news_trumpet.jpg" vspace="10" width="184">
      it is now possible to connect your Tibia account to an authenticator app, e.g. Google Authenticator.
      <br>
      <br>
      Just download an authenticator app you trust and connect it to your account by using the new section on the account management page.
      <br>
      <br>
      A detailed instruction, how to connect your account to an authenticator can be found
      here
      and
      here
      .
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>
       Important:
      </b>
      Please note that only registered accounts can be connected to an authenticator. Also, it is necessary to have a recovery key in order to get access to your account in case you lose your device on which your authenticator is installed.
      <br>
      <br>
      Together with the new option to protect registered accounts, we also implemented a few content fixes and changes, for example:
      <ul>
       <li>
        It is not possible anymore to get stuck in the mission
        <i>
         Phantom Army
        </i>
        during the
        <i>
         Children of the Revolution
        </i>
        quest.
       </li>
       <li>
        Seacrest pearls can now also be traded via the market.
       </li>
       <li>
        Furthermore, we added a door to the balcony of the Old Heritage Estate in Rathleton. Items that have been on the door field before the adjustment have been sent to the inbox of the house owner.
       </li>
       <li>
        In addition, some map bugs, graphical issues, typos and NPC dialogues have been fixed and adjusted as well.
       </li>
       <li>
        Last but not least, the limit of pending reports has been increased to 20.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Please note that a new client version is available. The patch will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also download the new stand-alone client version 10.72 from our
      download section
      .

      See you in Tibia!
