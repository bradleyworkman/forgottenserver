      omorrow, June 12, we are going to implement a couple of fixes and adjustments for the new PvP rule set that was released last week.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>
       Optional PvP:
      </b>
      <ul>
       <li>
        We fixed an issue that prevented players from aiming runes at squares on which another character was standing. This means it will be possible again to aim runes on other characters.
       </li>
       <li>
        Magic walls and wild growth plants will vanish if a character walks into them. However, if they are cast by a guild war participant, their blocking effects will apply to his war opponents. Magic walls or wild growth plants that were cast by a war participant will vanish if somebody who is not a war opponent of the casting character walks into them.
       </li>
       <li>
        Characters will not be able to attack their own summons anymore. Also, it will not be possible anymore to get damaged by your own summons.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <b>
       Open PvP:
      </b>
      <ul>
       <li>
        All area attacks will reach characters that are standing inside a magic wall or wild growth with all consequences.
       </li>
       <li>
        We fixed an issue that activated the red fist mode on Open PvP if a player was online on a Hardcore PvP world before switching to a character on an Open PvP world. When logging in on an Open PvP character, the default setting will be Secure Mode ON and Dove Mode On.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <b>
       Hardcore PvP:
      </b>
      <ul>
       <li>
        There will be no attack or damage restrictions anymore for characters standing in a stack. This means that any character in a stack can deal and receive damage.
       </li>
       <li>
        Snap-backs will no longer occur when bumping into other characters.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Please note again that these changes are not yet online. They will be released with tomorrow's server save.
