      ot only humans have found their way to the ice islands, also many creatures were able to adapt themselves to the icy climate. Some of them we would like to introduce to you today. Not all rest harmlessly on drifting ice floes like the sweet baby seals. Even the penguins are aggressive in this area and should be avoided especially by young adventurers as they mainly attack in a large group. Huge like his relative the elephant but with much more fur to withstand the cold, the mammoth tramps through the snow of the Ice Islands.
Not only animals, also some barbarians are a threat for everybody that is brave enough to explore this chilly area. Watch out for the young but fearless skullhunters, avoid the pointed arrows of the headsplitters and the sharp blades of the bloodwalkers. Exclusively women are trained as brutetamer to help the clan with their small magical abilities.

       A species which has only developed on the Ice Islands are the chakoyas. One should not fall for their cute look, they attack everything they are sighting and love it to spread chaos and mayhem. Today 3 different kinds of chakoyas are known: the chakoya tribewarden is a melee fighter whose task it is to protect the tribe; the chakoya toolshaper received its name from its skill to craft weapons and tools; finally, the chakoya windcaller is the most intelligent of its race and stands out for its magical abilities.

       Not only the icy weather will give you cold shivers if you dare to challenge the most creepiest and strongest creatures of the Ice Islands. Crystal spiders hurt their enemies with poison that painfully freezes the flesh and numbs the extremities. Ice golems are no less dangerous and are surely a challenge for experienced adventurers especially as they are mostly encountered in greater numbers than their stone cousins. Frost dragons are even mightier and more aggressive creatures than their relatives in warmer regions. The frost giant and its female counterpart belong to an ancient race that defends fiercely their grounds against any intruders. The braindeath, one of the most ancient beholders, does not only command powerful minions but also has a large array of powerful attacks.
