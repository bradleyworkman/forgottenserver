      the streets are empty - loud cheering echoes through the emptied alleys. Where is everybody...?
      <br>
      <br>
      Your eyes are immediately drawn to a new sparkling banner. You walk closer to have a better look... the cheering gets louder while you approach. What is this? You take out your glasses and read: You see an
      <i>
       arena banner
      </i>
      .
      <br>
      <br>
      Yes! This winter update will bring an
      <b>
       Arena System
      </b>
      to Tibia!
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>
       Please note that teaser information is always preliminary, and subject to change. Especially the later mentioned limits and timers are still in discussion. We hope for your feedback on the test server!
      </i>
      <br>
      <br>
      As a start, arenas can be found in Ankrahmun, Kazordoon, Thais, Edron, and Rathleton.
      <br>
      Each arena fight will be set up by one initiator. By talking to an NPC he picks a battle type and sets the details:
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>
       Type 1: Last Man Standing
      </b>
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The initiator determines an entrance fee and how many players will fight.
       </li>
       <li>
        He is teleported into a waiting area, other players will follow him manually. The battle starts when enough players have arrived.
       </li>
       <li>
        All participants are teleported into the battle ground to fight against each other.
       </li>
       <li>
        The entrance fee will be deducted from the bank accounts of participants.
       </li>
       <li>
        The fight lasts until only one character is left.
       </li>
       <li>
        The winner gets all the money that was deducted from everybody in the beginning, the losers will have lost the money but nothing else.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <b>
       Type 2: Team Deathmatch
      </b>
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The initiator sets the entrance fee, the team sizes, and enters the character names for each team.
       </li>
       <li>
        The two teams will gather in the waiting area, each team in a separate room.
       </li>
       <li>
        When everybody on the team lists has arrived, all participants are teleported into the battle ground to fight.
       </li>
       <li>
        The entrance fee will be deducted from the bank accounts of participants.
       </li>
       <li>
        The fight lasts until only members from one team are still alive.
       </li>
       <li>
        The money that was deducted from everybody in the beginning will now be devided equally and automatically among all members of the winning team, regardless of whether they died during the fight or not. The members of the losing team will have lost the money but nothing else.
       </li>
       <li>
        Extra hint: In this mode, specific 1 vs 1 fights are possible. To duel your friend, just set the team size to 1 and enter your friend's character name on the opponent list at the NPC.
       </li>
      </ul>

        <br>
        A special addition: Spectators are welcome! The roof of the battle ground is like glass. You can walk on it and look through it. Watch your friends and either cheer or laugh at them!
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>
         Extra information:
        </b>
        <br>
        <ul>
         <li>
          There are time limits for fights and the waiting periods.
         </li>
         <li>
          After a fight, participants are blocked from fights for some time before they can battle again.
         </li>
         <li>
          There will be a limit for the entrance fee, too.
         </li>
         <li>
          During the waiting period, players can decide against participation by leaving the waiting area. The only way out of a battle, though, is either death, victory, or a battle time out.
         </li>
         <li>
          PvP features like friendly fire will match the PvP options of your game world type. However, all kills in an arena will be justified. An arena death does not count as a frag in guild wars, and the usual death penalty will not be applied in arena fights.
         </li>
         <li>
          Arena battles will be a premium feature.
         </li>
        </ul>
        Get ready to test your PvP skills, Tibians!
