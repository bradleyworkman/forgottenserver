      It mainly focuses on the revamp of
      Grizzly Adams'
      paw and fur society tasks.
      <br>
      <br>
      As you may have read already in the teaser about the changes in Grizzly Adams' tasks, new level ranges have been set, available monster tasks have been more than doubled, you can now work on up to three tasks at the same time, the whole score system has been adjusted, and new bosses and boss achievements are available. Due to the feedback we got during the test, Grizzly Adams now also gives bonus task points for characters of level 130 and above.
      <br>
      <br>
      Besides, a couple of minor
      adjustments and changes
      have been made. For example, characters of all levels can now accept the missions and daily tasks of Eclesius, the scatterbrained sorcerer.
      <br>
      If you want to talk about quests and other gameplay topics with players from all game worlds, you should visit the new
      gameplay board
      .
      <br>
      <br>
      The update will download automatically when you log into the game. You can also
      download
      the new stand-alone client version 9.2 from our download section.
      <br>
      <br>
      Enjoy!
