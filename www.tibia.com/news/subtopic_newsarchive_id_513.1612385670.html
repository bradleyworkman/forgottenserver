      any of you have asked us via the
      feedback form
      to start the update teasers earlier. Good news! We will start our update teaser series for this year's summer update next Friday.
      <br>
      <br>
      This summer will get cold. The new icy area holds many secrets for Premium Account players to explore. Don't forget to bring your mittens and a warm scarf when we take you on a first trip to Svargrond - the new city whose roofs are covered with a soft blanket of snow. Learn more about the various chilly islands and the numerous creatures that adapted to this inhospitable freezing climate.
      <br>
      Don't forget to buy your
      Premium Account
      in time so you will be able to solve the mysteries of this frosty new area right from the start!
      <br>
      <br>
      Have fun in Tibia!
