       his research, Tibicus had found only vague indications concerning the existence of "Misguided", the elvish radical split-off "Barkless" and the cult of "Aeterna Exsistentia".
       <br>
       <br>
       Nevertheless, he was sure there was more to those rumours.
       <br>
       <br>
       He needed to talk to Gerimor again. The druid seemed to have greater knowledge about&nbsp;these cults and Tibicus had&nbsp;to know everything. He had come across sinister implications that further cults and their members were hiding in different&nbsp;places in Tibia.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what he had found out were to be true, it would mean that orcs, minotaurs even other humans had recently formed their own cults and made abandoned ancient ruins and caves their new&nbsp;home.&nbsp;Plotting in secret against the Tibian world as we know it.
       <br>
       <br>
       And unfortunately, Gerimor confirmed his theories. According to the druid there were at least four other secret cults.&nbsp;
