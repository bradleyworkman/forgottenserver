      he testing period is finally over and we are proud to present this year's Christmas update.
      <br>
      <br>
      New dungeons and quests on the continent of Darama are waiting to be explored by the brave adventurer. Beware, however, because randomly appearing monster hordes might cross your way! New graphics and items have been added and your private houses will especially benefit from the new colourful tapestries, pillows and other numerous objects. Also, many widely anticipated features are now also introduced in this update. Free players will especially enjoy the new login queue which gives them an equal chance to log in. Also the eagerly awaited skill bars and a permanent ignore list have been added. More information on all new features can be found in the
      manual
      .
      <br>
      <br>
      There are also some changes on the website. For example, we have removed the project section and added an
      experience table
      . Moreover, the house auctions have been revised.
      <br>
      <br>
      When you log into the game a patch for your client will be downloaded automatically. If you should encounter any problems, you can alternatively download the
      new client 7.4
      from this website.
      <br>
      <br>
      Enjoy the update!
