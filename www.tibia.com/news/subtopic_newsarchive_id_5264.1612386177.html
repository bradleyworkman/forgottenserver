        looking for an extra incentive to go hunting? The
        <strong>
         Hunting Tasks
        </strong>
        will reward you for killing scores of creatures.

       can be found under the prey dialog. It shares its window with the Prey Creatures, so you can easily switch between both of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       First you

       select the creature you want to hunt. You have a selection of nine beings to choose from, and, like when choosing a Prey Creature, the option to either use gold to roll a new selection or use prey wildcards to select your target from a list. The price for a Prey Creatures reroll will be increased from 50 gp per level to 200 gp per level with the update; it will then be equal to the price for a Hunting Tasks reroll. Afterwards you choose how many of this monster you want to kill. There are two different amounts which depend on the creature difficulty. The higher amount is only available once the bestiary entry for the respective creature has been completed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reward for finishing a task are Hunting Task Points. After confirming a task, you will be offered a certain reward and then have
       <img align="right" border="0" height="215" hspace="10" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/wu19_hunting_tasks_widget.png" vspace="7" width="178">
       the option to optimize it, to increase the amount of Hunting Task Points you will receive. Four and five star rewards also give a chance for additional Hunting Task Points. The Prey widget now keeps track of both your Prey Creatures as well as Hunting Tasks. Cancelling the task will require a fee equal to the fee for a reroll. After cancellation you can immediately create a new task.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have finished the task, you can claim your reward at once in the Hunting Tasks menu. The Hunting Task Points you receive can be exchanged at a new NPC, Walter Jaeger, located in Thais, for an outfit, a mount, or decorative items.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can complete one hunting task per slot between server saves. However, there is no time limit for completing a task. Players with a free account have one slot unlocked and can purchase up to two more slots while Premium players have two slots available and can purchase one new slot. Each additional slot costs 750 Tibia Coins.

        Control Buttons
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since there is now a sizeable amount of buttons for numerous widgets available in the UI, some of which you might not even use on a regular basis, you can now freely configure which ones are going to be displayed. There will be a new section in the options menu where you can select which buttons you want to display and in which order they are to appear in the interface. You can select any amount of buttons available, or none of them, in which case the space next to the options menu button and exit button (which remain ever-present) will be empty.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will now also be buttons available for the Quest Tracker and the Lenshelp.
