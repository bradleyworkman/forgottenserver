      was well after midnight and Amaro restlessly tossed and turned in his bed when the third vision struck him like a bolt of lightning. With eyes wide open he was staring into a roaring blackness. After a few breathless seconds, images started to swirl around in his head and he heard a loud and clear voice as if someone was standing right next to him.

      </i>
      Amaro flailed around with his arms. Someone WAS standing right next to him but it was too dark for Amaro to see who it was: "Utevo gran lux." Nothing happened. "By the gods, who are you? What do you want from me???"
