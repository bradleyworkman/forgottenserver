      fter a thorough preview phase and a couple of adjustments based on the feedback we received during the preview, we are going to implement the
      redesigned unjustified kill system
      on all Open PvP worlds tomorrow, August 26.
      <br>
      <br>
      We would like to thank all players who helped us with constructive feedback during the preview. Most of the criticism we received still focuses on the basic
      PvP rule set
      that was implemented last year and the vision behind that system. Nevertheless, we still consider this a decision that was vital to provide a transparent PvP system as a solid foundation to build on.
      <br>
      <br>

      With the redesigned unjustified kill system, we tried to address important points of the criticism from last year, for example by measuring the extent of participation in an unjustified kill scenario. Every aggressive action now yields a certain unjust value. An aggressive action is any PvP action that has a negative influence on another character. This includes damage (direct or indirect), negative effects (paralyse) and limitations to the freedom of movement (blocking, obstacles). Also, healing an aggressor is an aggressive action.
      <br>
      The unjust values for your individual actions will be visualised in a special bar in the client which fills up as you participate in unjustified kill scenarios. Thereby, it allows you to keep track of how close you are to getting a red or black skull and how long it will take to get rid of those skulls again.
      <br>
      In addition, the overall sum of sanctions in an unjustified kill scenario has been limited to the value of 5 unjustified kills in total which will be distributed over all attackers depending on their actions.
      <br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the display of PvP modes in your client has been slimmed down a bit to help you with PvP activations. The secure mode button still allows you to quickly switch between being able to freely attack other players and only being able to attack or block characters if they have been aggressive towards yourself. Players who would like to choose between all four PvP modes can do so via the expert mode.
      <br>
      As suggested by many players, we have also introduced the option to disable the PvP frames for the various PvP situations via the general options menu.
      <br>
      <br>
      The evaluation and consequences for blocking were a controversially discussed topic of the actual preview. Due to the feedback during the preview, we reduced the unjust value for pure blocking. While it will still count as participation and will be sanctioned it will not be counted as a full unjustified kill.
      <br>
      Also, we added a feature that was suggested during the preview: If a character dies by damage that came only from himself or his group members, it is considered suicide. In that case, if someone received a skull for blocking this character, it will not count as unjustified participation.
      <br>
      <br>
      With tomorrow's release, we are also addressing the PvP issue concerning white skulls hiding in stacks: If you are standing in a stack, you are now able to attack any skulled character (depending on your PvP setting).
      <br>
      <br>
      As already announced back in June, the end of the PvP preview also marks the
      <b>
       end of double experience and double skill gain
      </b>
      on Aurora and Aurera with tomorrow's server save.
      <br>
      Before switching the preview worlds to their normal state, though, we are going to launch another preview there tomorrow. This upcoming preview features an increased experience gain for killing monsters for all characters below level 50 to help new players getting into the more challenging parts of the game more quickly. Further information about this preview will be published tomorrow so stay tuned!
