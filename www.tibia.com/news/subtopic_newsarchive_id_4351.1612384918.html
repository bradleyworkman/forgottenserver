        are going to&nbsp;add a great new feature to the Cyclopedia.
       </img>
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Cyclopedia already contains profound information about many items in Tibia, you will now be able to look up helpful information about Tibian creatures as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gather enough information about a&nbsp;creature and you will be able to unlock the possibility to use a special bonus against the creature. But let us start with the Bestiary first.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Bestiary
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bestiary is&nbsp;a new addon for the Cyclopedia. In here, Tibian&nbsp;creatures are going to be sorted in different&nbsp;creature classes.
       <br>
       Initially, every creature and the&nbsp;creature class itself will be&nbsp;displayed as&nbsp;silhouettes. Gain information about creatures and thereby unlock and complete their Bestiary entries!
      </p>

       <img align="right" border="0" height="277" hspace="8" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/wu17_bestiary_cyclops.jpg', 'Bestiary', 'width=700, height=538')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/wu17_bestiary_cyclops_small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer;" vspace="0" width="360">
       unlock an entry, you will have to kill its&nbsp;corresponding creature. The first kill will&nbsp;open the entry and reveal the creature's name, sprite and its difficulty level. A kill counter will show you the required amount of kills to unlock more information.
      </p>
      <p>
       To successfully complete a&nbsp;creature entry, you will have to unlock&nbsp;a total of three&nbsp;detail stages.
       <br>
       The first stage will unlock basic information like hitpoints, speed, armour and common loot items, for example.
       <br>
       The second stage will allow you to see uncommon loot items, resistances and locations of where the&nbsp;creature can be found.
       <br>
       Once you have killed enough&nbsp;creatures to unlock the final stage, semi-rare and rare loot items will be displayed.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       How often you have to kill a&nbsp;creature to unlock more of its details is based on the creature's
       difficulty
       . The difficulty also determines the amount of
       <em>
        Charm Points
       </em>
       &nbsp;that you are going to receive once you have completed an entry.

       are offensive, defensive or passive bonus effects that need to be unlocked&nbsp;with Charm Points. An unlocked charm can only be assigned to a completed&nbsp;creature entry and will provide you with a bonus against the corresponding&nbsp;creature.
      </p>
      <p>
       While assigning a charm to an&nbsp;entry is free of charge, you will have to pay a gold fee if you want to detach the charm from the entry again. The required amount of gold depends on your character's level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that a creature entry can only have one&nbsp;charm assigned at a time. There is a total of 16 different charms available. A detailed list of all charms, their effects and their costs can be found
       here
       . Free account players can&nbsp;assign&nbsp;up to 2&nbsp;charms to different entries at the same time, while premium account players can&nbsp;assign 6 charms.
      </p>
      <p>
       A permanent possibility to&nbsp;assign all of your unlocked&nbsp;charms at the same time can be purchased via the Store. It also reduces the amount of gold you have to pay for&nbsp;every charm removal by 25%.
