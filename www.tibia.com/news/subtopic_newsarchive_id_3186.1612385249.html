I will also give you a list of interesting spots and landmarks we have not covered. If you venture there in your travels - please try to draw them on your map as good as you can. The more adventurers to help us, the more detailed our maps will become!"

        Now, this is a mission that suits me fine. I am on the road again. Finally! Time to dust my walking boots and my hiking backpack. I guess I will also have to visit Gorn in Thais before I start my journey. I need more papers for my travel diary, and a new inkwell won't hurt as well...
