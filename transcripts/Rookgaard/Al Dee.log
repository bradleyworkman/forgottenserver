''Player'': '''hi'''<br />
[[Al Dee]]: Hello, hello, ''Player''! Please come in, look, and buy! I'm a specialist for all sorts of '''tools'''. Just ask me for a '''trade''' to see my offers! You can also ask me for general '''hints''' about the game.<br />
''Player'': '''tools'''<br />
Al Dee: As an adventurer, you should always have at least a '''backpack''', a '''rope''', a '''shovel''', a '''weapon''', an '''armor''' and a '''shield'''.<br />
''Player'': '''trade'''<br />
Al Dee: Take a look in the trade window to your right.<br />
''Player'': '''backpack''' ''or'' '''rope''' ''or'' '''shovel'''<br />
Al Dee: Yes, I am selling that. Simply ask me for a '''trade''' to view all my offers.<br />
''Player'': '''weapon'''<br />
Al Dee: Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't deal with weapons. That's '''Obi's''' or '''Lee'Delle's''' business. I could offer you a '''pick''' in exchange for a '''small axe''' if you should happen to own one.<br />
''Player'': '''armor''' ''or'' '''shield'''<br />
Al Dee: Armor and shields can be bought at '''Dixi's''' or at '''Lee'Delle's'''. Dixi runs that shop near '''Obi's'''.<br />
''Player'': '''food'''<br />
Al Dee: Hmm, the best address to look for food might be '''Willie''' or '''Billy'''. '''Norma''' also has some snacks for sale.<br />
''Player'': '''potions'''<br />
Al Dee: Sorry, I don't sell potions. You should visit '''Lily''' for that.<br />
''Player'': '''cookies''' ''or'' '''fishing'''<br />
Al Dee: I sell fishing rods and worms if you want to fish. Simply ask me for a '''trade'''.<br />
''Player'': '''worms'''<br />
Al Dee: I have enough worms myself and don't want any more. Use them for fishing.<br />
''Player'': '''help''' ''or'' '''information'''<br />
Al Dee: If you need general equipment, just ask me for a '''trade'''. I can also provide you with some general '''hints''' about the game.<br />
''Player'': '''job'''<br />
Al Dee: I'm a merchant. Just ask me for a '''trade''' to see my offers.<br />
''Player'': '''name'''<br />
Al Dee: My name is Al Dee, but you can call me Al. Can I interest you in a '''trade'''?<br />
''Player'': '''time'''<br />
Al Dee: It's about 0:00 am. I'm so sorry, I have no watches to sell. Do you want to buy something else?<br />
''Player'': '''premium'''<br />
Al Dee: As a premium adventurer you have many advantages. You really should check them out!<br />
''Player'': '''king'''<br />
Al Dee: The king encouraged salesmen to travel here, but only I dared to take the risk, and a risk it was!<br />
''Player'': '''sell'''<br />
Al Dee: Just ask me for a '''trade''' to see what I buy from you.<br />
''Player'': '''wares''' ''or'' '''stuff'''<br />
Al Dee: Just ask me for a '''trade''' to see my offers.<br />
''Player'': '''pick''' ''or'' '''small axe'''<br />
Al Dee: Picks are hard to come by. I trade them only in exchange for high quality small axes. Would you like to make that deal?<br />
''Player'': '''dungeon'''<br />
Al Dee: If you want to explore the dungeons such as the '''sewers''', you have to '''equip''' yourself with the '''vital''' stuff I am selling. It's vital in the deepest sense of the word.<br />
''Player'': '''sewers'''<br />
Al Dee: Oh, our sewer system is very primitive - it's so primitive that it's overrun by '''rats'''. But the stuff I sell is safe from them. Just ask me for a '''trade''' to see it!<br />
''Player'': '''vital'''<br />
Al Dee: Well, vital means - necessary for you to survive!<br />
''Player'': '''rats'''<br />
Al Dee: Rats plague our '''sewers'''. You can sell fresh rat corpses to '''Seymour''' or '''Tom''' the tanner.<br />
''Player'': '''monsters'''<br />
Al Dee: If you want to challenge monsters in the '''dungeons''', you need some '''weapons''' and '''armor''' from the local '''merchants'''.<br />
''Player'': '''merchants'''<br />
Al Dee: To view the offers of a merchant, simply talk to him or her and ask for a '''trade'''. They will gladly show you their offers and also the things they buy from you.<br />
''Player'': '''Tibia'''<br />
Al Dee: One day I will return to the continent as a rich, a very rich man!<br />
''Player'': '''Rookgaard'''<br />
Al Dee: On the island of Rookgaard you can gather important experiences to prepare yourself for '''mainland'''.<br />
''Player'': '''mainland'''<br />
Al Dee: Have you ever wondered what that 'main' is people are talking about? Well, once you've reached level 8, you should talk to the '''oracle'''. You can choose a '''profession''' afterwards and explore much more of Tibia.<br />
''Player'': '''profession'''<br />
Al Dee: You will learn everything you need to know about professions once you've reached the '''Island of Destiny'''.<br />

''Player'': '''bank'''<br />
Al Dee: A bank is quite useful. You can deposit your money safely there. This way you don't have to carry it around with you all the time. You could also invest your money in my '''wares'''!<br />
''Player'': '''oracle'''<br />
Al Dee: You can find the oracle on the top floor of the '''academy''', just above '''Seymour'''. Go there when you are level 8.<br />
''Player'': '''temple'''<br />
Al Dee: The monk '''Cipfried''' takes care of our temple. He can heal you if you're badly injured or poisoned.<br />
''Player'': '''Dallheim''' ''or'' '''Zerbrus'''<br />
Al Dee: Some call him a hero. He protects the town from '''monsters'''.<br />
''Player'': '''Amber'''<br />
Al Dee: She's currently recovering from her travels in the '''academy'''. It's always nice to chat with her!<br />
''Player'': '''Billy'''<br />

''Player'': '''Cipfried'''<br />
Al Dee: He is just an old monk. However, he can heal you if you are badly injured or poisoned.<br />
''Player'': '''Dixi'''<br />

Al Dee: He mostly stays by himself. He's a hermit outside of town - good luck finding him.<br />
''Player'': '''Lee'Delle'''<br />

''Player'': '''Loui'''<br />
Al Dee: No idea who that is.<br />
''Player'': '''Norma'''<br />

Al Dee: Seymour is a teacher running the '''academy'''. He has many important '''information''' about Tibia.<br />
''Player'': '''Tom'''<br />
Al Dee: He's the local tanner. You could try selling fresh corpses or leather to him.<br />
''Player'': '''Willie'''<br />
Al Dee: This is a local farmer. If you need fresh '''food''' to regain your health, it's a good place to go. However, many monsters also carry food such as meat or cheese. Or you could simply pick '''blueberries'''.<br />
''Player'': '''Zirella'''<br />
Al Dee: Poor old woman, her son '''Tom''' never visits her.<br />
