''Player'': '''hi'''<br/>
[[Santiago]]: Hello again, ''player''! It's great to see you. If you like, we can chat a little. Just use the dark blue keywords again to choose a topic.<br/>

''Player'': '''keywords'''<br/>
[[Santiago]]: Right, this was a keyword. But actually there are more interesting topics to talk about.<br/>

''Player'': '''job'''<br/>
Santiago: I catch fish for a living. But I'm telling you, those cockroaches are ruining me.<br/>

''Player'': '''name'''<br/>
Santiago: Oh, my name is Santiago. I could tell you some gossip about me, harhar. I also know many stories.<br/>

''Player'': '''Time'''<br/>
Santiago: Time is passing slowly on Rookgaard, I can tell you!<br/>

''Player'': '''Rookgard'''<br/>
Santiago: We are currently south of the village of Rookgaard, just follow the path to the east. Once you are there, you will meet many other citizens.<br/>

''Player'': '''main'''<br/>
Santiago: The main continent is so much bigger than Rookgaard. You can travel there once you are level 8 and have chosen a vocation.<br/>

''Player'': '''vocation'''<br/>
Santiago: The Tibian vocations are knight, paladin, sorcerer and druid, each of them has its own specialities.<br/>

''Player'': '''knight'''<br/>
Santiago: Knights are strong melee fighters. They usually use weapons such as swords, clubs or axes.<br/>

''Player'': '''druid'''<br/>
Santiago: Druids are nature magic users, specialised in earth, ice and healing.<br/>

''Player'': '''paladin'''<br/>
Santiago: Paladins are distance fighters and holy magic users. They outrun their enemies and shoot them with arrows or bolts.<br/>

''Player'': '''sorcerer'''<br/>
Santiago: Sorcerers are elemental magic users, specialised in fire, energy and death magic.<br/>

''Player'': '''cockroach'''<br/>
Santiago: Every morning, I'm missing about a dozen fishes. Once, I've seen one of those beasts nibbling on a fish! They are SO disgusting!<br/>

''Player'': '''tibia'''<br/>
Santiago: Tibia is a huge world with many cities - most of them threatened by monsters. If you help us fighting them, you will earn experience and grow into a strong warrior.<br/>

''Player'': '''cities'''<br/>
Santiago: There are many cities on the main continent, much bigger than our little village here. You should visit all of them!<br/>

''Player'': '''monsters'''<br/>
Santiago: Here on Rookgaard, we are lucky that the monsters threatening our village are rather weak. I wouldn't want to have the dragons and demons of the main continent here!<br/>

''Player'': '''dragons'''<br/>
Santiago: You'll never forget your first dragon. That is true even after all those years. Fierce beasts they are!<br/>

''Player'': '''demons'''<br/>
Santiago: There are numerous different demons all over Tibia. They mostly hide deep in dungeons, but sometimes they dare entering the human realm.<br/>

''Player'': '''citizens'''<br/>
Santiago: Most of the citizens are merchants. We have also two guards and a healer, and a teacher in our academy.<br/>

''Player'': '''santiago'''<br/>
Santiago: Everyone in Tibia has a job, and I'm a fisherman! Well - I used to be a famous pirate, to be honest, but all those adventures were too much for me.<br/>

''Player'': '''gossip'''<br/>
Santiago: Did you hear that story about me catching this HUUUUGE fish?! It was so big that I couldn't pull it on board of my ship... and... and ...<br/>

''Player'': '''stories'''<br/>
Santiago: There are so many things I could tell you, I don't even know where to start! My best stories are about Svargrond and the explorer society.<br/>

''Player'': '''merchants'''<br/>
Santiago: We have a weapon smith called Obi, Dixi is selling armors and Al Dee is offering general tools. Also, you can buy potions from Lily. I think those are the most important people to trade with.<br/>

''Player'': '''guards'''<br/>
Santiago: The bridge guards Dallheim and Zerbrus can tell you which monsters are suitable for your level and where to find them.<br/>

''Player'': '''healer'''<br/>
Santiago: Our healer is called Cipfried. He guards the temple.<br/>

''Player'': '''teacher'''<br/>
Santiago: The teacher of the academy is called Seymour. The academy is just north of the temple.<br/>

''Player'': '''fisherman'''<br/>
Santiago: To be a fisherman, you only need a fishing rod and worms. You can become one too! Fishing rods can be bought in all cities, even in Rookgaard.<br/>

''Player'': '''pirate'''<br/>
Santiago: Oh, that life is over. I've settled down. Fighting against those cockroaches is the only excitement I have nowadays, and that's already enough!<br/>

''Player'': '''adventures'''<br/>
Santiago: You'll experience more than enough adventures soon enough, I'm sure! You look young and strong, Tibia awaits you!<br/>

''Player'': '''svargrond'''<br/>
Santiago: There was a huge fuzz about it. Actually no one ever knew that it existed until a while ago when the sea serpents which had blocked the sea passage there suddenly disappeared ...<br/>
Santiago: Nowadays there is a barbarian settlement, and I heard that you need to win a drinking contest to become an inhabitant! Now that's something! ...<br/>
Santiago: Also, there are many different types of fish. They catch them through ice holes there.<br/>

''Player'': '''explorer society'''<br/>
Santiago: The explorer society has always work for brave adventurers. You can join them in Port Hope or Northport once you arrive on the main continent.<br/>

''Player'': '''port hope'''<br/>
Santiago: That's a small settlement in the south of Tibia. The jungle of Tiquanda is all around it. There are many places to discover like Banuta, Trapwood or Chor.<br/>

''Player'': '''northport'''<br/>
Santiago: That's a very small village near one of the main cities, Carlin. I considered living there because it's almost as quiet as Rookgaard.<br/>

''Player'': '''banuta'''<br/>
Santiago: That is the name of the ape town. They say there is an ape who can talk! I don't believe that, harharhar!<br/>

''Player'': '''chor'''<br/>
Santiago: This place was discovered some years ago. It's a lizard town and those snake-human mixed thingies are still there! I wonder why they haven't been discovered earlier.<br/>

''Player'': '''trapwood'''<br/>
Santiago: Wild horses couldn't drag me there!! Evil little beasts called dworcs live there. They use a weird type of voodoo magic.<br/>

''Player'': '''trade'''<br/>
Santiago: Oh sorry, I don't trade. But if you meet other citizens, it can't hurt to ask them for a trade! If they have offers or buy your stuff, they'll tell you.<br/>

''Player'': '''obi'''<br/>
Santiago: Obi is a skilled smith. If you need weapons, you can buy them at his shop.<br/>

''Player'': '''dixi'''<br/>
Santiago: She's Obi's granddaughter and deals with armors and shields, just upstairs from Obi's shop.<br/>

''Player'': '''al dee'''<br/>
Santiago: Al Dee sells tools such as torches, ropes and shovels. You will learn about them soon!<br/>

''Player'': '''lily'''<br/>
Santiago: Lily's shop is just behind the bridge that leads to the village. She sells potions which will refill your health or cure poison.<br/>

''Player'': '''dallheim or zerbrus'''<br/>
Santiago: He's a great warrior. He can also tell you much about monsters and dungeons on this island.<br/>

''Player'': '''cipfried'''<br/>
Santiago: Visiting Cipfried is a good idea if you are badly injured or poisoned. Just ask him for a heal.<br/>

''Player'': '''seymour'''<br/>
Santiago: Seymour is a teacher running the academy. He has many important information about Tibia.<br/>

''Player'': '''experience'''<br/>
Santiago: Earning experience and gaining levels will make you stronger. It's all about power in Tibia!<br/>

''Player'': '''warrior'''<br/>
Santiago: Well, everybody is a 'warrior' in general. You can choose between four vocations once you are level 8.<br/>

''Player'': '''quest'''<br/>
Santiago: I think apart from killing cockroaches there's no quest I could give you. There are many more quests on the main continent, just ask around!<br/>

''Player'': '''oracle'''<br/>
Santiago: Oh, you're a bit young to hear about the oracle. Be patient, you'll learn everything in time.<br/>

''Player'': '''bye'''<br/>
Santiago: Take care, ''player''!<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: If you don't know the meaning of an icon on the right side, move the mouse cursor on it and wait a moment.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Send private messages to other players by right-clicking on the player or the player's name and select 'Message to ....'. You can also open a 'private message channel' and type in the name of the player.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Use the shortcuts 'SHIFT' to look, 'CTRL' for use and 'ALT' for attack when clicking on an object or player.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: If you already know where you want to go, click on the automap and your character will walk there automatically if the location is reachable and not too far away.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: To open or close skills, battle or VIP list, click on the corresponding button to the right.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: 'Capacity' restricts the amount of things you can carry with you. It raises with each level.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Always have a look on your health bar. If you see that you do not regenerate health points anymore, eat something.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Always eat as much food as possible. This way, you'll regenerate health points for a longer period of time.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: After you have killed a monster, you have 10 seconds in which the corpse is not moveable and no one else but you can loot it.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Be careful when you approach three or more monsters because you only can block the attacks of two. In such a situation even a few rats can do severe damage or even kill you.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: There are many ways to gather food. Many creatures drop food but you can also pick blueberries or bake your own bread. If you have a fishing rod and worms in your inventory, you can also try to catch a fish.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Baking bread is rather complex. First of all you need a scythe to harvest wheat. Then you use the wheat with a millstone to get flour. ...<br/>
Santiago: This can be be used on water to get dough, which can be used on an oven to bake bread. Use milk instead of water to get cake dough.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Dying hurts! Better run away than risk your life. You are going to lose experience and skill points when you die.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: When you switch to 'Offensive Fighting', you deal out more damage but you also get hurt more easily.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: When you are on low health and need to run away from a monster, switch to 'Defensive Fighting' and the monster will hit you less severely.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Many creatures try to run away from you. Select 'Chase Opponent' to follow them.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: The deeper you enter a dungeon, the more dangerous it will be. Approach every dungeon with utmost care or an unexpected creature might kill you. This will result in losing experience and skill points.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Due to the perspective, some objects in Tibia are not located at the spot they seem to appear (ladders, windows, lamps). Try clicking on the floor tile the object would lie on.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: If you want to trade an item with another player, right-click on the item and select 'Trade with ...', then click on the player with whom you want to trade.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Stairs, ladders and dungeon entrances are marked as yellow dots on the automap.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: You can get food by killing animals or monsters. You can also pick blueberries or bake your own bread. If you are too lazy or own too much money, you can also buy food.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Quest containers can be recognised easily. They don't open up regularly but display a message 'You have found ....'. They can only be opened once.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Better run away than risk to die. You'll lose experience and skill points each time you die.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: You can assign spells, the use of items, or random text to 'hotkeys'. You find them under 'Options'.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: You can also follow other players. Just right-click on the player and select 'Follow'.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: You can found a party with your friends by right-clicking on a player and selecting 'Invite to Party'. If you are invited to a party, right-click on yourself and select 'Join Party'.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: Only found parties with people you trust. You can attack people in your party without getting a skull. This is helpful for training your skills, but can be abused to kill people without having to fear negative consequences.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
Santiago: The leader of a party has the option to distribute gathered experience among all players in the party. If you are the leader, right-click on yourself and select 'Enable Shared Experience'.<br/>

''Player'': '''hints'''<br/>
