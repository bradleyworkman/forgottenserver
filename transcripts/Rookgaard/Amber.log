''Player'': '''adventure'''<br/>
Amber: I fought fierce monsters, climbed the highest mountains, and crossed the sea on a raft.<br/>

''Player'': '''Tibia'''<br/>

''Player'': '''cyclopses''' or '''minotaurs''' or '''dragons'''<br/>
Amber: Horrible monsters they are.<br/>
''Player'': '''orcs'''<br/>
Amber: Not the nicest guys you can encounter. I had some clashes with them and was prisoner of the orcs for some months.<br/>
''Player'': '''prisoner'''<br/>
Amber: I speak some orcish words, not much though, just 'yes' and 'no' and such basic.<br/>
''Player'': '''orcish'''<br/>

''Player'': '''orcish'''<br/>
Amber: I speak some orcish words, not much though, just 'yes' and 'no' and such basic.<br/>
