[[Seymour]]: Hello, ''Player''. What do you need?<br/>

''Player'': '''[[gods]]'''<br/>
Seymour: You can learn much about Tibia's gods in our library.<br/>

''Player'': '''help''' or '''hints'''<br/>
Seymour: I can assist you with my advice.<br/>

''Player'': '''advice'''<br/>
Seymour: Read the blackboard for some hints and visit the training center in the cellar.<br/>

''Player'': '''training''' or '''cellar'''<br/>
Seymour: You can try some basic things down there, but don't challenge the monsters in our arena if you are inexperienced.<br/>

''Player'': '''monsters'''<br/>
Seymour: You can learn about Tibia's monsters in our library.<br/>

''Player'': '''job'''<br/>
Seymour: I am the master of this fine [[Rookgaard Academy|academy]].<br/>

''Player'': '''[[Rookgaard Academy|academy]]'''<br/>
Seymour: Our academy has a library, a training center in the cellars and the oracle upstairs.<br/>

''Player'': '''library'''<br/>
Seymour: Go and read our books. Ignorance may mean death, so be careful.<br/>

''Player'': '''name'''<br/>
Seymour: My name is Seymour, but to you I am 'Sir' Seymour.<br/>

''Player'': '''time'''<br/>
Seymour: It is 8:26 pm, so you are late. Hurry!<br/>

''Player'': '''king'''<br/>
Seymour: Hail to King [[Tibianus]]! Long live our king! Not that he cares for an old veteran who is stuck on this godforsaken island...<br/>

''Player'': '''magic'''<br/>
Seymour: The only magic-user on this isle is old [[Hyacinth]].<br/>

''Player'': '''Tibia'''<br/>
Seymour: Oh, how I miss the crowded streets of [[Thais]]. I know one day I will get promoted and get a job at the castle... I must get out of here! The faster the better! It is people like you who are driving me mad.<br/>

''Player'': '''sell'''<br/>
Seymour: I sell the Key to Adventure for 5 gold! If you are interested, tell me that you want to buy the key.<br/>

''Player'': '''key'''<br/>
Seymour: Do you want to buy the Key to Adventure for 5 gold coins?<br/>

''Player'': '''no'''<br/>
Seymour: As you wish.<br/>

''Player'': '''mission''' or '''quest'''<br/>
Seymour: Well I would like to send our king a little present, but I do not have a suitable box. If you find a nice box, please bring it to me.<br/>

''Player'': '''box'''<br/>
Seymour: Do you have a suitable present box for me?<br/>

''Player'': '''no'''<br/>
Seymour: HEY! You don't have one! Stop playing tricks on me or I will give some extra work!<br/>

''Player'': '''weapon'''<br/>
Seymour: You need fine weapons to fight the tougher beasts. Unfortunately only the most basic weapons and armor are available here. You will have to fight some monsters to get a better weapon.<br/>

''Player'': '''castle'''<br/>
Seymour: The [[Rain Castle|castle of Thais]] is the greatest achievement in Tibian history.<br/>

''Player'': '''dungeon'''<br/>
Seymour: There are some dungeons on this isle. You should strong enough to explore them now, but make sure to take a rope with you.<br/>

''Player'': '''[[oracle]]''' or '''vocation'''<br/>
Seymour: You will find the [[oracle]] upstairs. Talk to the oracle as soon as you have made level 8. Choose a vocation and a new home town, and you will be sent off to the continent.<br/>

''Player'': '''rat'''<br/>

''Player'': '''no'''<br/>

''Player'': '''[[Al Dee]]'''<br/>
Seymour: He is a shop owner in the northwestern part of the village.<br/>

''Player'': '''[[Amber]]'''<br/>
Seymour: A traveller from the main land. I wonder what brought her here, since no one comes here of his own free will.<br/>

''Player'': '''[[Cipfried]]'''<br/>
Seymour: A humble monk with healing powers, and a pupil of the great Quentin himself.<br/>

''Player'': '''[[Dallheim]]'''<br/>
Seymour: Oh good Dallheim! What a fighter he is! Without him we would be doomed.<br/>
